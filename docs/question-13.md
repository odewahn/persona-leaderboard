Absolutely, this is a common challenge in high-performing engineering teams, and it’s great that you’re proactively seeking to support your engineer’s growth. Here’s how I’d approach this, drawing on the frameworks and practical advice from Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent leadership discussions:

1. Recognize the “Generalist” Antipattern
When an engineer spreads themselves too thin across multiple domains, they risk becoming a “generalist” without true mastery in any area. While versatility is valuable, it can dilute depth, ownership, and impact. You’ll often notice that such engineers are involved everywhere, but their contributions lack the depth needed for critical problem-solving or innovation. Tasks they start may often be handed off to specialists for completion, and their sense of ownership can be diminished .

Action:

Have a candid conversation with the engineer about the value of developing a T-shaped skill set: deep expertise in one area (the vertical bar of the T) while maintaining the ability to collaborate across domains (the horizontal bar) .
2. Guide Them to Focus on High-Impact Areas
Encourage the engineer to identify where their unique strengths and interests align with the team’s most critical needs. Ask them to reflect on what they do with relative ease that others find challenging, and where their contributions can have the most significant impact. Concentration—doing one major thing at a time—is the secret to effectiveness in engineering .

Action:

Work together to select one or two key areas for them to focus on, ideally where their strengths and the team’s priorities intersect.
Set clear, measurable goals for deepening expertise in these areas.
3. Structure Opportunities for Mastery
Support their development by providing structured opportunities to build depth:

Assign them ownership of a specific module or project area.
Encourage participation in code reviews, design discussions, and technical deep-dives related to their focus area.
Schedule regular check-ins to discuss progress, challenges, and learning goals .
Action:

Recommend they dedicate time each week to hands-on work, learning, and reflection in their chosen area.
Suggest attending relevant workshops, conferences, or online courses to accelerate their growth .
4. Foster a Culture of Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration
Encourage the engineer to share their learning journey with the team—through documentation, tech talks, or mentoring others. This not only reinforces their expertise but also builds social capital and trust within the team .

Action:

Pair them with a mentor or senior engineer who can provide guidance and feedback.
Create opportunities for them to present their work or lead discussions in their area of focus.
5. Regularly Revisit and Adjust
Growth is iterative. Check in regularly to ensure the engineer feels challenged but not overwhelmed, and that their focus area remains aligned with both their aspirations and the team’s evolving needs .

Action:

Use one-on-ones to discuss their progress, celebrate milestones, and adjust focus as needed.
Encourage them to reflect on their journey and identify new areas for growth as they build mastery.
By helping your engineer move from breadth to depth, you’re not only supporting their professional development but also strengthening your team’s overall capability and resilience.

Great question — this is a classic tech leadership challenge, and one that Addy Osmani has addressed in both *Leading Effective Engineering Teams* and various talks.

Let’s unpack it in Addy’s voice and style:

---

**"Generalists are valuable, but even they need depth in something to truly accelerate impact. Your job as a leader is to help your engineers align their interests with high-leverage areas for the team — and then create space for depth."**

### Here’s how you can approach this:

#### 1. **Have a focused 1:1 on growth and impact**

Start with curiosity, not criticism:

* “What areas are you most excited about?”
* “Where do you feel you're making the most meaningful impact?”
* “Are there areas where you feel spread too thin?”

> As Addy might say: “Help them reflect, not just redirect.”

From this, identify:

* what they *want* to go deep in, and
* what the *team needs* someone to go deep in.

Look for overlap — that’s the sweet spot.

#### 2. **Define a "spike" area**

Encourage them to pick one area to **go deep** on for the next 1–2 quarters. This doesn't mean abandoning all other work, but it means **prioritizing** learning, ownership, and measurable impact in that domain.

> “Specialization isn't forever. It's a season. But mastery requires momentum.”

Use goals like:

* Owning a system or service end-to-end
* Driving performance improvements
* Writing internal documentation or leading knowledge-sharing

#### 3. **Create space for deep work**

Make sure they’re not constantly getting pulled into support or context-switching across projects. Addy often stresses **minimizing cognitive overhead**. That means:

* Reducing the number of concurrent responsibilities
* Saying “no” to low-leverage tasks
* Protecting time for learning and contribution

#### 4. **Celebrate depth as much as delivery**

Publicly recognize not just *what* they build, but the *craft* and *expertise* they bring to it. In Addy’s teams, engineers who master areas become **go-to people**, not just executors.

> “People thrive when they see their skills respected — and used.”

Certainly! Helping an engineer focus and develop expertise is a common challenge, but it's also an opportunity for growth for both the individual and the team. Here are some strategies you might consider:

1. **Understand Their Interests and Goals**: Have a one-on-one conversation to understand what areas they are truly passionate about. Sometimes engineers spread themselves thin because they haven't found their niche yet. Encourage them to reflect on what excites them the most and where they see themselves growing.

2. **Set Clear Objectives**: Work together to set clear, achievable goals that align with both their interests and the team's needs. This could involve identifying a specific project or technology they can focus on. Make sure these goals are measurable and time-bound to provide a sense of progress and achievement.

3. **Encourage Depth Over Breadth**: Explain the value of deep expertise in one area before branching out. Use examples of successful engineers who have made significant contributions by focusing deeply on a particular domain. Highlight how mastery in one area can lead to greater impact and recognition.

4. **Provide Resources and Support**: Offer resources such as books, courses, or mentorship opportunities that can help them deepen their knowledge. Pair them with a more experienced engineer who can guide them and provide feedback on their work.

5. **Create Opportunities for Focused Work**: Ensure they have the time and space to concentrate on their chosen area. This might mean adjusting their workload or shielding them from distractions and unrelated tasks. Encourage them to block out dedicated time for deep work.

6. **Regular Check-ins and Feedback**: Schedule regular check-ins to discuss their progress and any challenges they might be facing. Provide constructive feedback and celebrate their achievements to keep them motivated.

7. **Encourage Sharing and Teaching**: Once they start gaining expertise, encourage them to share their knowledge with the team through presentations, documentation, or mentoring others. Teaching is a powerful way to solidify one's understanding and build confidence.

8. **Be Patient and Supportive**: Mastery takes time, and there will be ups and downs along the way. Be patient and supportive, and remind them that it's okay to make mistakes as long as they learn from them.

By guiding them through this process, you'll help them develop a deeper expertise that not only benefits them personally but also strengthens the team as a whole.

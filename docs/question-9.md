Great question ‚Äî and it's one that shows you *care*, which already puts you ahead. Drawing from **Addy Osmani‚Äôs approach** in *"Leading Effective Engineering Teams"* and his leadership talks, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd guide you:

---

### üß† 1. **Think Outcomes, Not Just Output**

One of Addy‚Äôs core beliefs is aligning feedback with *impact*, not just activity.

> üí¨ ‚ÄúInstead of saying ‚Äòyou didn‚Äôt write tests,‚Äô try: ‚ÄòWhen we don‚Äôt include tests, it increases the risk of regressions, which can slow down the team later. Let‚Äôs look at how we can improve this together.‚Äô‚Äù

üîπ **Tip:** Frame feedback around how behaviors affect the *team*, *users*, or *velocity*. Keep it connected to shared goals.

---

### üîÑ 2. **Make Feedback Continuous, Not Just Scheduled**

Don‚Äôt wait for performance reviews or 1:1s.

> üí° Addy emphasizes *real-time micro-feedback* ‚Äî brief, specific notes given close to the moment.

üîπ **Tip:** Practice "observe ‚Üí reflect ‚Üí comment" in the flow of work. For example, drop a quick Slack DM after a great PR or to offer a small improvement suggestion.

---

### üßä 3. **Start with Psychological Safety**

Addy often talks about how *feedback only works when trust exists*.

> üí¨ ‚ÄúWhen teams feel safe to fail and grow, feedback becomes a tool for improvement instead of a threat.‚Äù

üîπ **Tip:** Normalize *two-way* feedback. Ask: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one thing I could do better as your manager?‚Äù You'll build a habit of mutual growth.

---

### üéØ 4. **Use the SBI Model (Situation‚ÄìBehavior‚ÄìImpact)**

This structure aligns with Addy‚Äôs push for clarity and empathy.

* **Situation**: When did it happen?
* **Behavior**: What did they do?
* **Impact**: What was the result?

üîπ Example:

> ‚ÄúIn yesterday‚Äôs planning meeting (situation), you cut off a teammate mid-sentence (behavior). It made it harder for them to contribute their ideas (impact). Can we talk about that?‚Äù

---

### üõ†Ô∏è 5. **Tailor Feedback to the Individual**

From Addy‚Äôs work, one key insight is: *engineers are not interchangeable*. Know how each person prefers to receive input.

> üß† ‚ÄúSome people want direct feedback. Others need more context or private settings. Use 1:1s to learn this.‚Äù

üîπ **Tip:** Ask during onboarding or 1:1s: ‚ÄúHow do you prefer to receive feedback ‚Äî in the moment, async, or in our 1:1s?‚Äù

---

### üìà 6. **Give As Much Positive as Constructive Feedback**

From a motivation perspective, Addy is big on developer morale and retention.

> üí¨ ‚ÄúEngineers should know what ‚Äògreat‚Äô looks like ‚Äî and feel seen when they do it.‚Äù

üîπ **Tip:** Use positive feedback to reinforce behaviors you want to see more of. Don‚Äôt wait until someone‚Äôs slipping.

---

### üí¨ Practice Example:

Let‚Äôs say someone consistently misses deadlines.

‚ùå Avoid:

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always late.‚Äù

‚úÖ Try:

> ‚ÄúI noticed the last two sprints had features slip past the deadline. Can you walk me through what‚Äôs getting in the way? Let‚Äôs see if we can unblock it together.‚Äù

---

### üìö Addy-Inspired Practices You Can Adopt Now

* **Feedback Journaling:** Keep a doc of feedback moments for each team member so you‚Äôre ready with specifics.
* **1:1 Feedback Cadence:** Build a rhythm (e.g. one growth topic every other 1:1).
* **PR Feedback Coaching:** Use PRs as a low-stakes feedback tool‚Äîhelp your team improve code and communication.

---

Would you like a **feedback template** you can use in 1:1s or Slack? Or we could role-play a few scenarios you're dealing with.

Absolutely, providing effective feedback is a crucial skill for any engineering manager. Here are some strategies you can use to improve your feedback skills, inspired by principles from leadership literature and practices:

### 1. **Be Specific and Actionable**
   - **Focus on Behavior, Not Personality**: When giving feedback, concentrate on specific actions or behaviors rather than making it personal. For example, instead of saying "You are not a good communicator," you might say, "In the last meeting, I noticed that your points were not clearly articulated, which led to some confusion."
   - **Provide Clear Examples**: Use concrete examples to illustrate your points. This helps the team member understand exactly what they did well or what needs improvement.

### 2. **Use the "Sandwich" Method**
   - **Positive-Constructive-Positive**: Start with something positive, then address the area for improvement, and finish with another positive note. This approach helps to soften the impact of constructive criticism and keeps the conversation balanced.

### 3. **Encourage Two-Way Dialogue**
   - **Ask for Their Perspective**: After providing feedback, invite the team member to share their thoughts. This not only shows that you value their input but also helps you understand their viewpoint and any challenges they may be facing.
   - **Active Listening**: Practice active listening by summarizing what they say and asking follow-up questions. This builds trust and rapport.

### 4. **Set Regular Feedback Cycles**
   - **Frequent Check-Ins**: Instead of waiting for formal reviews, establish regular one-on-one meetings where feedback can be exchanged more naturally. This creates a culture of continuous improvement and openness.
   - **Feedback Culture**: Encourage your team to give each other feedback as well. This can help normalize the process and make it less daunting.

### 5. **Focus on Growth and Development**
   - **Link Feedback to Goals**: Connect your feedback to the individual‚Äôs career goals or team objectives. This helps them see the value in the feedback and how it can aid their professional development.
   - **Offer Support**: When pointing out areas for improvement, also provide resources or suggestions on how they can improve. This could be recommending training, mentorship, or specific projects to work on.

### 6. **Be Mindful of Timing and Environment**
   - **Choose the Right Moment**: Timing is crucial. Provide feedback as soon as possible after the observed behavior, but ensure it‚Äôs in a private and comfortable setting where the individual can focus on the conversation without distractions.
   - **Be Aware of Emotions**: If the feedback is particularly sensitive, be mindful of the emotional state of the person receiving it. Approach the conversation with empathy.

### 7. **Model Feedback Behavior**
   - **Lead by Example**: Show your team how to give and receive feedback by being open to feedback yourself. Share your own experiences and how you‚Äôve grown from feedback you‚Äôve received.

### 8. **Follow Up**
   - **Check Progress**: After giving feedback, follow up to see how the individual is progressing. This shows that you care about their development and reinforces the importance of the feedback.

### 9. **Seek Feedback on Your Feedback**
   - **Ask for Input**: After providing feedback, ask the team member how they felt about the conversation. This can help you refine your approach and make adjustments for future interactions.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a more constructive feedback environment that fosters growth and collaboration within your team. Remember, feedback is a skill that improves with practice, so be patient with yourself as you develop this important aspect of your leadership.

As Addy Osmani, I'd be glad to share some strategies to help you provide effective feedback to your team. Providing feedback is a crucial part of being an engineering manager, and doing it well can significantly impact your team's performance and morale. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. **Be Specific and Actionable**: When giving feedback, be clear about what the issue is and provide specific examples. Instead of saying, "Your code needs improvement," you might say, "In the last project, I noticed that the code lacked comments, which made it difficult for others to understand. Adding comments can improve code readability."

2. **Timeliness**: Provide feedback as soon as possible after the event or behavior you want to address. This ensures that the context is fresh in everyone's mind and allows for quicker adjustments.

3. **Balance Positive and Constructive Feedback**: While it's important to address areas for improvement, don't forget to acknowledge what your team members are doing well. This balance helps maintain morale and encourages positive behavior.

4. **Use the SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact)**: This model helps structure your feedback. Describe the Situation, explain the specific Behavior, and discuss the Impact it had. For example, "During the team meeting (Situation), you interrupted others frequently (Behavior), which made it difficult for them to share their ideas (Impact)."

5. **Encourage a Growth Mindset**: Frame feedback in a way that encourages learning and development. Emphasize that skills can be developed through effort and persistence.

6. **Create a Safe Environment**: Foster an environment where team members feel comfortable receiving and giving feedback. Encourage open communication and make it clear that feedback is a tool for growth, not criticism.

7. **Listen Actively**: Feedback should be a two-way conversation. Listen to your team member's perspective and be open to their input. This can provide valuable insights and help build trust.

8. **Follow Up**: After providing feedback, check in with your team members to see how they're progressing. Offer additional support or resources if needed, and acknowledge improvements.

9. **Tailor Your Approach**: Different team members may respond differently to feedback. Understand their individual preferences and adapt your approach accordingly.

10. **Practice Empathy**: Put yourself in your team member's shoes and consider how they might feel receiving the feedback. This can help you deliver it in a more compassionate and effective manner.

By incorporating these strategies, you'll be better equipped to provide feedback that is constructive, supportive, and ultimately beneficial for your team's growth and success. Remember, effective feedback is a skill that improves with practice, so keep refining your approach as you gain more experience.

Hey there! First off, congrats on stepping into the engineering manager role. It's a journey filled with opportunities to grow both yourself and your team. Providing effective feedback is a crucial part of that journey, and it's great that you're focusing on improving this skill. Let's dive into some strategies that can help you deliver feedback that's clear, constructive, and impactful.

**1. Be Specific and Actionable:** When giving feedback, aim for clarity. Instead of saying, "Your code needs improvement," try something like, "I noticed the function `calculateMetrics` could be more efficient by using a hashmap instead of a list for lookups." This gives your team member a clear direction on what to improve.

**2. Balance Positive and Constructive Feedback:** It's important to recognize what's working well, not just what's not. This helps build confidence and reinforces positive behaviors. A good rule of thumb is the "praise sandwich"‚Äîstart with something positive, provide constructive feedback, and end on a positive note.

**3. Focus on Behavior, Not Personality:** Keep feedback objective and centered on actions or outcomes. Instead of saying, "You're not a team player," you might say, "I noticed you didn't participate in the last two team meetings. Your input is valuable, and we'd love to hear your thoughts."

**4. Encourage a Growth Mindset:** Frame feedback in a way that encourages learning and development. Use language that suggests improvement is possible and expected. For example, "With a bit more focus on testing, your code quality could really shine."

**5. Create a Safe Environment:** Psychological safety is key. Ensure your team feels comfortable receiving feedback by fostering an environment of trust and respect. Encourage open dialogue and be approachable.

**6. Regular Check-ins:** Don't wait for formal reviews to give feedback. Regular one-on-ones are a great opportunity to provide ongoing feedback and support. This helps prevent surprises and keeps everyone aligned.

**7. Ask for Feedback:** Feedback is a two-way street. Encourage your team to give you feedback on your management style and how you can support them better. This not only helps you grow but also models the behavior you want to see.

**8. Document and Follow Up:** Keep track of feedback given and follow up on progress. This shows that you care about their development and are invested in their success.

Remember, feedback is a tool for growth, not criticism. Approach it with empathy and the intent to help your team succeed. Over time, you'll find your own rhythm and style that works best for you and your team. Keep iterating and learning‚Äîyou're on the right path!

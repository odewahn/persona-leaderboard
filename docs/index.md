# Methodology

Each model was asked the same 20 questions and then evaluated based on an average of the Burrows Delta and Andrew Model metrics. The questions are:

- I'm a new engineering leader and my team struggles with meeting deadlines. How can I improve our team's effectiveness and ensure we meet our goals?
- I'm managing a team that lacks psychological safety, and team members are hesitant to share ideas. What strategies can I use to foster a more open and innovative environment?
- I'm leading a diverse team, and while diversity is beneficial, we're facing coordination challenges. How can I create an inclusive environment that leverages our diversity effectively?
- I'm a new engineering leader and my team is delivering a lot of code, but I'm not sure if we're focusing on the right things. How can I ensure that we're being effective and not just efficient?
- As an engineering leader, I'm trying to balance the productivity of my team with the quality of our output. How can I measure and improve both efficiency and effectiveness without sacrificing one for the other?
- I'm leading a team that has recently transitioned to using microservices and Kubernetes. While we've improved our deployment speed, user feedback indicates no significant improvements in performance or usability. How can I refocus my team to ensure our technical advancements translate into real user benefits?
- I'm a new engineering leader and I'm struggling to define what effectiveness means for my team. How can I go about establishing a clear definition that aligns with our organization's goals?
- I'm an engineering leader with some experience, and I'm facing challenges with empowering my team to take ownership of their work. What strategies can I use to foster autonomy and accountability?
- I'm an experienced engineering leader, and I'm looking to scale the effectiveness of my team across the organization. What are some advanced strategies for expanding our success patterns to larger teams?
- I'm a new engineering manager and I'm struggling to provide effective feedback to my team. What strategies can I use to improve my feedback skills?
- I'm an engineering leader trying to create a more inclusive team environment. What actions can I take to ensure all team members feel valued and supported?
- I'm leading a large engineering team and want to ensure psychological safety. How can I foster an environment where team members feel safe to express their ideas and concerns?
- I'm a new engineering leader and I've noticed that one of my team members is always the go-to person for a specific module. How can I ensure that this doesn't become a problem for the team?
- I'm managing a team where one engineer is trying to work on multiple areas but isn't mastering any. How can I help them focus and develop expertise?

The following text is a selection called {{tag}} from {{title}} by {{author}}:

{{content}}

First, read the selection and think of a few questions that a beginning, intermediate, and advanced  {{role}} might ask based on the passage.  The question should be framed in terms of some hypothetical challenge that {{role}} is facing that the selection could help answer.  For example, "I'm a {{role}} and I'm facing the problem <foo>.  What do you recommend?"  Foo is some hypothetical challenge that could be answered by the passage.  For example:

* For a leadership selection, you might have a quesion like "I'm managing a team with an engineer who produces great work but is a poor communicator.  Can you help me with some strategies to help her work more effectively with the rest of the team?

* For a software development section, a question might look like: "I'm trying to understand how to use object-oriented design effectively.  Can you help explain it?"


Put these in a section formatted something like this:

<thinking>

  <question>
    <level>...</level>
    <question>...</question>
  </question>
  ...
</thinking>.

Then, go back through the list of questions and pull out the best ones, making sure to select at least one question for each level of experience, like this:

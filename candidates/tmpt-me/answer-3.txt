As a new engineering leader, it's crucial to distinguish between being effective and merely efficient. While delivering a lot of code might indicate high productivity, it doesn't necessarily mean that the team is focusing on the most impactful tasks. To ensure effectiveness, start by prioritizing outcomes over outputs. This means aligning your team's efforts with the broader business goals and ensuring that the work they do contributes to these objectives.

Implement goal-setting frameworks that emphasize the importance of doing the right things. Encourage your team to understand the impact of their work on the overall project and organizational goals. Additionally, use metrics that measure outcomes and business value rather than just the volume of code produced. This approach will help you and your team focus on delivering meaningful results that align with your strategic objectives.

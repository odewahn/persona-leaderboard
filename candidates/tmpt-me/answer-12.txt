It's great that you're proactive about addressing this potential issue. When one team member becomes the sole expert on a module, it can create a single point of failure. To mitigate this, encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration within your team. You can start by organizing internal tech talks where the expert shares insights about the module with others. Additionally, consider implementing cross-training programs where team members rotate roles or pair up to work on different parts of the project. This not only broadens the team's skill set but also reduces dependency on a single individual. Lastly, ensure that comprehensive documentation is maintained so that knowledge is accessible to everyone, fostering a more resilient and adaptable team.

To prevent the formation of knowledge silos and ensure expertise is distributed across your team, consider implementing a few key strategies. First, encourage cross-training and collaboration among team members. This can be achieved by pairing junior engineers with more experienced ones, allowing them to learn from each other and gain insights into different areas of the project. 

Additionally, promote the sharing of code ownership and documentation. This helps ensure that knowledge is not concentrated with a few individuals but is accessible to the entire team. Organizing internal tech talks and workshops can also facilitate knowledge sharing and foster a culture of continuous learning.

Finally, consider instituting rotation programs where team members can work on different components or projects. This not only broadens their skill sets but also helps in breaking down silos, leading to a more versatile and resilient team.

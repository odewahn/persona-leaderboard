Providing effective feedback is a crucial skill for any engineering manager, and it's great that you're looking to improve in this area. Start by being specific and actionable in your feedback. Focus on concrete examples and provide clear suggestions for improvement, avoiding vague generalities. This helps your team understand exactly what they can do to grow.

Additionally, ensure that your feedback is timely. Address issues or praise achievements soon after they occur to maintain relevance and impact. Regular check-ins can also be beneficial, as they provide ongoing opportunities for feedback and discussion, rather than waiting for formal evaluations.

Finally, foster an open dialogue by encouraging your team to share their feedback with you as well. This two-way communication can help you understand their perspectives and improve team dynamics. Remember, feedback is not just about pointing out areas for improvement but also recognizing and celebrating achievements.

It's great that you've made strides in deployment speed, but it's crucial to ensure that these technical advancements also enhance user experience. Start by revisiting the "why" behind your transition to microservices and Kubernetes. Engage with your users to understand their needs and pain points, and use this feedback to guide your team's efforts. Encourage your team to focus on designing features that directly address user concerns and improve usability.

Additionally, establish clear metrics that align with user satisfaction and performance improvements. These metrics will help your team measure the impact of their work on the user experience. Finally, foster a culture of continuous feedback and iteration, where your team regularly assesses the effectiveness of their solutions and makes necessary adjustments to better serve your users. By aligning technical goals with user-centric outcomes, you can ensure that your advancements lead to meaningful improvements for your users.

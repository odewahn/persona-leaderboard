It's great that you're looking to support your engineer in developing deeper expertise. Start by having a candid conversation with them about their career goals and interests. This will help you understand where their true passions lie and guide them towards a specialization that aligns with both their interests and the team's needs. Encourage them to focus on developing a T-shaped skill set, where they can have deep expertise in one area while still maintaining a broad understanding of other domains.

You can also pair them with a mentor who has expertise in their area of interest. This mentorship can provide guidance, support, and hands-on experience, which are crucial for deepening their knowledge. Additionally, consider setting specific goals and milestones for their development in the chosen area, and provide opportunities for them to work on projects that require this expertise. Finally, encourage them to engage in continuous learning through courses, workshops, or conferences to further solidify their skills.

To ensure that your team is being effective and not just efficient, consider implementing the following strategies:

1. Set clear goals and priorities: Clearly define the goals and priorities for your team to ensure that everyone is aligned on what needs to be achieved. This will help focus efforts on the most important tasks and avoid wasting time on less critical activities.

2. Regularly review progress and outcomes: Schedule regular check-ins with your team to review progress and outcomes. This will help you assess whether the team is on track to meet its goals and identify any areas that may need adjustment.

3. Encourage collaboration and communication: Foster a culture of collaboration and open communication within your team. Encourage team members to share ideas, provide feedback, and work together to solve problems. This will help ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and that decisions are made collectively.

4. Measure success beyond code delivery: While delivering code is important, it is also essential to measure success beyond just the quantity of code produced. Consider metrics such as code quality, customer satisfaction, and impact on business goals to evaluate the effectiveness of your team.

5. Continuously improve processes and workflows: Encourage your team to continuously improve processes and workflows to increase efficiency and effectiveness. This could involve implementing new tools, adopting best practices, or refining existing processes to streamline work and deliver better results.

By implementing these strategies, you can ensure that your team is not only delivering code efficiently but also focusing on the right things to achieve overall effectiveness.

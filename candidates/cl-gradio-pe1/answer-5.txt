To bridge that gap between technical improvements and user benefits, start by looping your team back into the "why" behind your changes. First, revisit user feedback with your team to identify areas where performance or usability can be truly enhanced. Foster a mindset that values outcomes over outputs. Engage your engineers in user empathy exercises like shadowing support or participating in usability tests—this builds a connection between their work and user needs. Next, empower them to propose solutions that address both the technical and experiential aspects, perhaps through workshops focused on user journey mapping. Finally, set clear OKRs that align technical improvements with user impact, and make performance metrics a regular part of your discussions to ensure everyone sees the real-world effects. Keep communication channels open, and remember—technology should serve users, not the other way around.

Focus on aligning your team's efforts with the broader business objectives. Start by understanding the larger context of your projects—what are the strategic goals? Communicate these to your team clearly. Encourage them to ask questions and fully understand the purpose behind their work. It’s important to emphasize effectiveness over sheer volume. Consider pairing team members with product managers to help them see the impact of their work. Regularly check in on priorities and ensure they’re aligned with delivering the most value. This approach will help your team do the right things, not just more things.

Improving your feedback skills is vital for team growth. Start by being specific and actionable in your feedback. Avoid generalities; focus on concrete examples. Balance positive feedback with constructive insights to maintain motivation. Tailor your feedback to individual needs and styles—everyone absorbs information differently. Regular follow-ups are crucial. Check in on progress and offer support, creating a loop of improvement and encouragement. Trial and error in your one-on-one meetings is okay; they’re a space for growth for both you and your team. Be open to learning and adapting—feedback is a two-way street.

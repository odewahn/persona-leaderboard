Ah, the classic challenge of knowledge silos. It can sneak up on any team if you're not careful. Here's what I've found effective: Encourage regular cross-training and rotation of responsibilities. Pair junior members with senior folks via mentorship programs to spread the wealth of knowledge. Regularly hold knowledge-sharing sessions or tech talks—these can democratize expertise. I’ve also seen the value of solid documentation in keeping knowledge accessible. Remember, it’s about creating an environment where sharing and learning are the norm. This way, you're ensuring resilience and adaptability across your team.

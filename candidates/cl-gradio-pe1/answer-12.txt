Ah, a classic scenario! Youâ€™re looking at a potential knowledge bottleneck. To avoid this becoming a single point of failure, emphasize knowledge distribution and team resilience. Encourage cross-training so others can learn that specific module. Regular knowledge-sharing sessions or tech talks can help, too. Pair programming is another great way for others to gain insights while strengthening collaboration. Think about implementing a rotation of responsibilities so your team doesn't rely heavily on one person. Mentorship can foster this exchange, ensuring expertise is more widely distributed. This approach helps in mitigating risks and keeps the team's capabilities balanced and scalable.

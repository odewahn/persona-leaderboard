Addressing this is all about striking the right balance. Sit down with the engineer and have a focused conversation about their strengths and interests. Help them identify one specific area of the project where they can develop mastery. Encourage them to dive deep there, while still keeping a general sense of the project. This way, they gain depth without losing breadth. Pair them with specialists to learn from, and provide regular feedback. Creating a tailored learning plan can guide their focus and foster growth. Remember, progress towards mastery is a huge motivator, so align their goals with the team's needs.

Great question! It’s common for new leaders to grapple with this distinction. Think of leadership as setting the vision and inspiring growth and change. It’s about motivating your team, empowering them to solve problems, and guiding them through transitions. Management, meanwhile, is about maintaining stability and order—it’s your role to plan, organize, and ensure that day-to-day operations run smoothly.

To balance these roles effectively, integrate leadership qualities with your managerial tasks. Establish a strategic vision that aligns with your long-term goals, and motivate your team by understanding what excites them. Trust and empower your team members to make decisions, fostering innovation and creativity.

Stay adaptable through change and set clear communication channels. Remember, the best managers blend leadership into their practice, leading to something dynamic and thriving. Keep focusing on clarity, empathy, and creating a high-trust environment. That’s your pathway to building effective engineering teams.

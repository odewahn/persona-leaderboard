Transitioning from an individual contributor to a management role can be tough, and it's completely normal to struggle with letting go of technical tasks. Here's a strategy that might help: Focus on empowering and trusting your team. Start by having open conversations, sharing the team’s goals, and encouraging your engineers to take ownership of tasks. It’s crucial to shift from "me" to "we," and allow team members to solve problems independently. Also, use one-on-one meetings to mentor and understand their needs. Don't forget to set boundaries for your involvement, prioritizing strategic planning over day-to-day coding. Finally, embrace the role of a coach, supporting your team to excel and grow. This shift takes time, but it will ultimately enhance both your effectiveness and the team's success.

Congratulations on your new role as an engineering leader! It's great that you're thinking about effectiveness versus just efficiency. Here are some strategies to ensure your team is focusing on the right things:

1. **Align with Business Goals**: Make sure your team's work aligns with the broader business objectives. Regularly communicate with stakeholders to understand the company's priorities and ensure your team's efforts are contributing to those goals.

2. **Define Clear Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**: Use OKRs to set clear, measurable goals for your team. This helps in aligning the team's work with the company's strategic objectives and provides a framework for evaluating success.

3. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**: Encourage your team to focus on high-impact work. Use frameworks like the Eisenhower Matrix or RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) scoring to prioritize tasks that deliver the most value.

4. **Foster a Culture of Feedback**: Create an environment where feedback is encouraged and valued. Regularly solicit feedback from your team and stakeholders to ensure you're on the right track and make adjustments as needed.

5. **Measure Outcomes, Not Just Output**: Focus on the impact of the work rather than the volume of code delivered. Use metrics that reflect the value delivered to users, such as user engagement, performance improvements, or customer satisfaction.

6. **Encourage Innovation and Experimentation**: Allow your team the freedom to experiment and innovate. This can lead to more effective solutions and help the team stay engaged and motivated.

7. **Regularly Review and Reflect**: Conduct regular retrospectives to reflect on what’s working and what’s not. Use these insights to continuously improve processes and focus areas.

8. **Empower Your Team**: Trust your team to make decisions and take ownership of their work. Empowered teams are more likely to focus on meaningful work and find effective solutions.

9. **Stay Informed and Adapt**: Keep up with industry trends and technological advancements. Encourage your team to do the same, and be willing to adapt your strategies and focus areas as needed.

10. **Communicate Vision and Purpose**: Clearly communicate the vision and purpose behind the work. When the team understands the "why," they are more likely to focus on the right things and be motivated to achieve the desired outcomes.

By focusing on these strategies, you can help ensure that your team is not just efficient in delivering code, but also effective in delivering value to the organization.

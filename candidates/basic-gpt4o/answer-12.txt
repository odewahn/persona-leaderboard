Congratulations on your new role as an engineering leader! It's great that you're already thinking about the long-term health and resilience of your team. Having a single go-to person for a specific module can indeed become a bottleneck and a risk if not managed properly. Here are some strategies to mitigate this issue:

1. **Knowledge Sharing**: Encourage the go-to person to share their knowledge with the rest of the team. This can be done through regular knowledge-sharing sessions, documentation, or pair programming. The goal is to distribute the expertise across the team.

2. **Documentation**: Ensure that the module is well-documented. This includes not only code comments but also higher-level documentation that explains the architecture, design decisions, and common pitfalls. This will help other team members understand the module more easily.

3. **Cross-Training**: Rotate team members through different parts of the codebase, including the module in question. This can be done through pair programming or by assigning different team members to work on tasks related to the module. Cross-training helps build redundancy and resilience in the team.

4. **Mentorship**: Encourage the go-to person to mentor other team members. This not only helps spread knowledge but also develops leadership skills in the go-to person and fosters a culture of collaboration and learning.

5. **Encourage Collaboration**: Foster a culture where team members feel comfortable asking questions and collaborating. This can help reduce the dependency on a single person and encourage a more team-oriented approach to problem-solving.

6. **Identify and Develop Backups**: Identify other team members who can serve as backups for the module. Provide them with opportunities to work on the module and gain the necessary expertise.

7. **Regular Reviews**: Conduct regular code and design reviews that involve multiple team members. This not only improves code quality but also ensures that more people are familiar with the module.

8. **Recognize and Reward**: Acknowledge the contributions of the go-to person and others who take the initiative to learn and share knowledge. Recognition can motivate team members to continue contributing to the team's success.

By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that your team is more resilient and that knowledge is distributed more evenly. This will reduce the risk of bottlenecks and create a more collaborative and supportive team environment.

Congratulations on your new role—this is a pivotal moment in your career, and your experience is a common one among new engineering managers. Addy Osmani’s Leading Effective Engineering Teams offers a wealth of practical advice and real-world examples to help you navigate this transition with confidence and clarity.

Key Insights and Strategies
1. Embrace the Mindset Shift: From “Me” to “We”
One of the most important changes is moving from a focus on your own technical output to enabling the success of your team. As Addy Osmani shares from his own experience at Google:

“I realized that, to scale myself, I had to shift my mindset from ‘me’ to ‘we.’ By collaborating with others, sharing what I learned, and focusing on lifting the skills and expertise of people around me, ‘we’ started to get so much more done.”
—Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams 

This shift means your impact is now measured by your team’s achievements, not just your individual contributions.

2. Let Go of Hands-On Technical Tasks
It’s natural to feel the urge to stay involved in coding and technical problem-solving, especially if that’s where you’ve found satisfaction and success. However, Osmani emphasizes:

“Engineers who become managers should consciously spend less time doing focused technical work, like coding. Instead, they must invest in one-on-one mentoring, running team meetings, working with different teams, and managing people.”
—Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams 

You may miss the immediate gratification of solving technical problems, but the rewards of building trust, developing your team, and seeing their growth are longer-lasting and more impactful.

3. Focus on People Management and Communication
Your new priorities should include:

Building rapport: Schedule one-on-ones to understand each team member’s strengths, weaknesses, and concerns.
Mentoring and coaching: Invest time in developing your team’s skills and confidence.
Clear communication: Set expectations, share your vision, and actively listen to feedback.
Empowerment: Avoid micromanagement. Trust your team to solve problems and make decisions, stepping in only when necessary .
4. Maintain Technical Oversight—But Don’t Micromanage
While you should step back from day-to-day coding, it’s important to stay technically informed so you can provide relevant guidance and unblock your team when needed. Osmani notes:

“While the engineering manager may not have any hands-on coding time, they should maintain their technical acumen.”
—Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams 

This balance allows you to support your team’s technical decisions without undermining their autonomy.

5. Address Common Challenges Proactively
New managers often face:

Imposter syndrome: It’s normal to feel overwhelmed at first. Be transparent with your team about your learning journey.
Scope mismanagement: Learn to say no to unnecessary change requests and keep the team focused on priorities .
Skeptical leadership: Avoid second-guessing your team’s technical choices without cause, as this can erode trust .
6. Practical Steps for a Strong Start
Meet individually with team members to build relationships and understand team dynamics.
Assess the project’s status and familiarize yourself with the tech stack to make informed decisions.
Address immediate concerns—whether technical or organizational—to build credibility early on .

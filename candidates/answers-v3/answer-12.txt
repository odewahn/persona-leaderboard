Absolutely, this is a classic scenario that many engineering leaders encounter, and it’s great that you’re spotting it early. When a single team member becomes the “go-to” expert for a module, it can create a single point of failure and lead to knowledge silos—both of which can undermine your team’s resilience and long-term effectiveness. Here’s how I’d approach this, drawing on the principles and real-world strategies I’ve shared in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent leadership discussions :

Why This Is a Problem
When one person holds all the knowledge about a module, several risks emerge:

Single Point of Failure: If that person is unavailable (vacation, illness, or leaves the company), progress can stall or critical issues may go unresolved.
Knowledge Silos: Other team members miss out on learning opportunities, and the team’s collective problem-solving ability is diminished.
Stunted Growth: The specialist may become overburdened, and others may not develop the skills or confidence to contribute meaningfully to that area.
Team Dependency: Over-reliance on one person can lead to burnout and reduce overall team autonomy .
Practical Steps to Distribute Knowledge and Reduce Risk
Here’s a set of actionable strategies you can implement:

1. Encourage Cross-Training and Pair Programming
Pair the module expert with other engineers on tasks, code reviews, or bug fixes related to the module.
Rotate responsibilities so others get hands-on experience and context, not just theoretical knowledge .
2. Promote Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
Ask the expert to document exceptional cases, FAQs, and the rationale behind key decisions in the module.
Organize regular knowledge-sharing sessions or internal tech talks where the expert walks the team through the module’s architecture, common pitfalls, and best practices .
3. Foster a Culture of Collaboration
Encourage open communication and a “no-blame” environment where team members feel safe to ask questions and admit what they don’t know.
Reward teamwork and knowledge sharing, not just individual heroics .
4. Mentorship and Peer Learning
Set up mentorship or buddy systems, pairing less experienced team members with the expert for onboarding or specific projects.
Encourage the expert to delegate tasks and act as a reviewer, rather than the sole implementer .
5. Monitor and Adjust
During one-on-ones, check in with both the expert and other team members about their learning goals and comfort level with the module.
Nudge the expert to explore other areas of the codebase, broadening their own growth while making space for others to step up .
Real-World Example
On the Chrome team, we faced similar bottlenecks as our codebase grew. We broke down silos by instituting cross-training, rotating code ownership, and pairing junior engineers with veterans. This not only distributed expertise but also scaled our team’s capabilities without increasing headcount .

The Goal
Aim for a “high bus factor”—meaning, if any one person were to leave, the project would continue smoothly. Ideally, every expert should have at least one or two backups who are 60–80% as knowledgeable as they are about the module .

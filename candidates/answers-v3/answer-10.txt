Absolutely, I’m glad you’re prioritizing inclusion and support—these are foundational for high-performing engineering teams. Drawing from my experience and the frameworks outlined in Leading Effective Engineering Teams as well as recent leadership discussions, here’s a practical, research-backed approach you can take:

1. Proactively Welcome and Onboard New Team Members
Assign a buddy or mentor to each new joiner, introduce them to the team, and provide resources for a smooth onboarding. This helps new members feel valued and included from day one, reducing the anxiety of joining a new environment and accelerating their integration into the team’s culture .
2. Build Rapport and Foster Team Connections
Encourage team-building activities—whether it’s virtual coffee chats, team lunches, or collaborative problem-solving sessions. These informal interactions help break down barriers, build trust, and create a sense of belonging, especially in remote or distributed teams .
3. Celebrate Successes and Recognize Contributions
Be an enthusiastic cheerleader for your team. Publicly acknowledge both team and individual achievements, and ensure credit is given where it’s due. Recognition boosts morale and reinforces that everyone’s work matters .
4. Provide Constructive Feedback and Growth Opportunities
Offer feedback that is both supportive and developmental. Focus on helping team members grow, not just pointing out mistakes. Empower people with autonomy and opportunities to take on new challenges, which signals trust and investment in their professional journey .
5. Create Psychological Safety
Foster an environment where everyone feels safe to speak up, share ideas, and admit mistakes without fear of embarrassment or retribution. Encourage open dialogue, actively listen to different perspectives, and address conflicts promptly and respectfully. Psychological safety is the single most important factor in team effectiveness, as highlighted by Google’s Project Aristotle .
6. Embrace and Celebrate Diversity
Go beyond hiring for diversity—actively cultivate an inclusive culture. Provide diversity and inclusion training, encourage open communication, and ensure equal opportunities for growth and development. Flexible work arrangements can help accommodate diverse needs and lifestyles, making everyone feel respected and supported .
7. Address Unconscious Bias
Conduct regular unconscious bias training and create safe spaces for team members to discuss their experiences. Open conversations about bias help surface and address issues before they impact team dynamics .
8. Role-Model Civility and Empathy
Lead by example: treat everyone with dignity, show genuine concern for their well-being, and be approachable. When leaders demonstrate respect and empathy, it sets the tone for the entire team .
9. Connect Individual Work to Broader Impact
Help each team member see how their work ties into the organization’s goals and vision. When people understand the impact of their contributions, they feel more engaged and motivated .
10. Regularly Check In and Solicit Feedback
Have frequent one-on-ones to understand how team members are feeling, what challenges they’re facing, and how you can support them. Actively listen and act on their feedback to continuously improve the team environment .
Practical Example
At Google, I’ve seen the power of round-robin sessions where every team member, regardless of seniority, is given uninterrupted time to share their thoughts. This not only encourages quieter voices to speak up but also helps senior members practice active listening. Such practices, combined with a culture of open feedback and recognition, have consistently led to more cohesive and innovative teams .

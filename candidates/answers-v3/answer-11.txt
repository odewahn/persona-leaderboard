Ensuring psychological safety in a large engineering team is foundational for innovation, engagement, and long-term success. Drawing from Addy Osmani’s Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the live event Tech Leadership Tuesday with Lena Reinhard: Leading Effective Engineering Teams in the Age of Generative AI with Addy Osmani, here are actionable strategies and key insights to help you foster an environment where team members feel genuinely safe to express their ideas and concerns.

Key Insights & Practical Strategies
1. Model and Nurture Psychological Safety
As Addy Osmani emphasizes in Leading Effective Engineering Teams:

“As a team leader, you must nurture psychological safety so that team members feel safe speaking up, taking risks, and admitting mistakes. Creating psychological safety in a tech team setting involves proactive measures by the leader. Great leaders allow unconventional ideas and celebrate failures as learning opportunities. This environment fosters creative thinking without fear of embarrassment.”
— Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams 

How to apply this:

Publicly thank team members for raising concerns or sharing ideas, especially when they challenge the status quo.
Facilitate open, nonjudgmental discussions and ask open-ended questions to encourage broader participation.
Celebrate learning from failures, not just successes, to normalize risk-taking and experimentation.
2. Encourage Open Communication and Inclusive Dialogue
“Avoid monopolizing discussions and allow team members to speak. Foster an environment where all team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas, questions, and concerns. Encourage active participation, constructive contributions, and open dialogue, especially from remote team members.”
— Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams 

How to apply this:

Rotate meeting roles (facilitator, notetaker) to distribute responsibility and give everyone a voice.
Use anonymous forums or regular “Ideas and Concerns” sessions to surface input from quieter or more introverted team members.
Pair junior members with senior mentors to bridge experience gaps and foster trust.
3. Build an Inclusive and Supportive Team Culture
“A good manager understands that to create an inclusive team environment, one has to show concern for success and well-being. They create a safe space for team members to share their ideas and opinions, encourage them to think creatively and solve problems, show concern for the health of colleagues by offering support if they’re having personal issues, encourage team members to learn from mistakes without judgment, and take time to get to know each team member personally.”
— Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams 

How to apply this:

Proactively welcome new team members and assign buddies for onboarding.
Regularly check in on team members’ well-being, not just their work output.
Recognize and celebrate cultural and individual differences through team rituals or “cultural exchange” meetups.
4. Approach Conflict as a Collaborator, Not an Adversary
“Approach conflict as a collaborator, not an adversary. Look at conflicts optimistically as opportunities for growth and learning. Instead of taking sides or assigning blame, managers should facilitate open and respectful discussions where all parties involved can express their perspectives.”
— Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams 

How to apply this:

Frame disagreements as opportunities for collective problem-solving.
Use language that is empathetic and inclusive—“speak human to human.”
Anticipate reactions to sensitive topics and plan supportive responses.
5. Maintain High Standards Alongside Psychological Safety
“Managers who want to foster psychological safety in their teams must understand that doing so does not mean relaxing performance standards. You cannot allow inappropriate conduct just to ensure team members feel safe. Performance standards and psychological safety must both be high for people to speak up and voice concerns.”
— Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams 

How to apply this:

Set clear expectations for both behavior and results.
Address issues constructively and fairly, ensuring accountability without blame.
Reinforce that psychological safety is about enabling high performance, not avoiding difficult conversations.
6. Adapting to the Age of AI and Change
In the context of generative AI and rapid technological change, Lena Reinhard and Addy Osmani highlight:

“Learn techniques for building psychological safety when introducing AI tools and managing team concerns about AI's impact on their roles... preserving human connection and creativity while integrating powerful new capabilities.”
— Addy Osmani & Lena Reinhard, Tech Leadership Tuesday with Lena Reinhard: Leading Effective Engineering Teams in the Age of Generative AI with Addy Osmani 

How to apply this:

Be transparent about how new tools (like AI) will impact workflows and roles.
Invite feedback and concerns about technology adoption, and address them openly.
Ensure that new tools enhance, rather than bypass, opportunities for learning and collaboration.

Additional Recommendations
Regularly measure psychological safety (e.g., through surveys or retrospectives) to identify areas for improvement.
Lead by example: admit your own mistakes and show vulnerability to normalize this behavior for others.
Invest in ongoing leadership development to stay attuned to evolving team needs, especially as technology and team structures change.

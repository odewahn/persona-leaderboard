This is a fantastic and very timely question—one that every engineering leader faces, especially in fast-moving environments. Delivering a lot of code can feel productive, but as you’ve sensed, output alone doesn’t guarantee you’re solving the right problems or driving meaningful impact. Let’s break down how you can ensure your team is truly effective, not just efficient, drawing on the frameworks and practical advice from Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the recent Tech Leadership Tuesday session.

Understanding Effectiveness vs. Efficiency
First, it’s crucial to distinguish between efficiency and effectiveness:

Efficiency is about doing things right—minimizing waste, maximizing output, and streamlining processes. For example, your team might be shipping features quickly and with clean code.
Effectiveness is about doing the right things—delivering outcomes that matter to your users and your business. It’s not just about how much you deliver, but whether what you deliver actually solves real problems and creates value.
Productivity is output over input, but it’s only meaningful if the output is valuable .
If your team is highly efficient but not effective, you risk building features that don’t move the needle for your users or your company.

Shifting Focus: From Output to Outcomes
To ensure your team is effective:

Align with Business and User Goals: Regularly revisit your team’s objectives and ensure they map directly to business outcomes or user needs. Ask: “How does this feature or project help our users or advance our company’s strategy?” 
Prioritize Ruthlessly: Use frameworks like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to set clear, outcome-oriented goals. This helps the team focus on what matters most, not just what’s easy or interesting to build .
Measure What Matters: Track metrics that reflect real impact—user adoption, customer satisfaction, business KPIs—not just velocity or number of pull requests .
Seek Feedback Early and Often: Engage stakeholders and users throughout the development process. Their feedback is a reality check on whether you’re solving the right problems .
Building a Culture of Effectiveness
Foster Psychological Safety: Encourage your team to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and share concerns if they feel work isn’t aligned with the right goals. This openness is foundational for course-correcting early .
Clarify Roles and Responsibilities: Make sure everyone knows not just what to do, but why it matters. This clarity helps avoid wasted effort and keeps the team focused .
Balance Efficiency with Innovation: Streamline processes where possible, but don’t over-optimize to the point that you stifle creativity or adaptability. Leave room for experimentation and learning .
Practical Steps for New Leaders
Here’s a simple checklist to get started:

Step	Action	Why It Matters
1	Review your team’s current goals and backlog	Ensure alignment with business/user outcomes 
2	Set or revisit OKRs with your team	Focus on outcomes, not just outputs 
3	Implement regular stakeholder check-ins	Validate you’re solving the right problems 
4	Track both delivery metrics and impact metrics	Balance efficiency and effectiveness 
5	Encourage open discussion about priorities	Build psychological safety and adaptability 

Navigating the Age of AI
If your team is leveraging AI tools, be especially mindful:

Don’t Over-Rely on AI for Output: Always verify AI-generated code and ensure it aligns with your standards and goals. Human review is essential .
Maintain Critical Thinking: Encourage engineers (especially juniors) to understand and explain what AI-generated code is doing, so you don’t lose sight of the “why” behind your work .
Focus on Real Value: Avoid shipping features just because AI makes it easy—ensure every release is genuinely useful to your users .
Final Thought
As a new leader, your most important job is to keep your team focused on delivering value, not just volume. By setting clear, outcome-driven goals, fostering a culture of open communication, and regularly validating your direction with stakeholders, you’ll ensure your team is not just busy, but truly effective.

Great question — this is a classic tech leadership challenge, and one that Addy Osmani has addressed in both *Leading Effective Engineering Teams* and various talks.

Let’s unpack it in Addy’s voice and style:

---

**"Generalists are valuable, but even they need depth in something to truly accelerate impact. Your job as a leader is to help your engineers align their interests with high-leverage areas for the team — and then create space for depth."**

### Here’s how you can approach this:

#### 1. **Have a focused 1:1 on growth and impact**

Start with curiosity, not criticism:

* “What areas are you most excited about?”
* “Where do you feel you're making the most meaningful impact?”
* “Are there areas where you feel spread too thin?”

> As Addy might say: “Help them reflect, not just redirect.”

From this, identify:

* what they *want* to go deep in, and
* what the *team needs* someone to go deep in.

Look for overlap — that’s the sweet spot.

#### 2. **Define a "spike" area**

Encourage them to pick one area to **go deep** on for the next 1–2 quarters. This doesn't mean abandoning all other work, but it means **prioritizing** learning, ownership, and measurable impact in that domain.

> “Specialization isn't forever. It's a season. But mastery requires momentum.”

Use goals like:

* Owning a system or service end-to-end
* Driving performance improvements
* Writing internal documentation or leading knowledge-sharing

#### 3. **Create space for deep work**

Make sure they’re not constantly getting pulled into support or context-switching across projects. Addy often stresses **minimizing cognitive overhead**. That means:

* Reducing the number of concurrent responsibilities
* Saying “no” to low-leverage tasks
* Protecting time for learning and contribution

#### 4. **Celebrate depth as much as delivery**

Publicly recognize not just *what* they build, but the *craft* and *expertise* they bring to it. In Addy’s teams, engineers who master areas become **go-to people**, not just executors.

> “People thrive when they see their skills respected — and used.”

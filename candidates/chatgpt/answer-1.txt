Great question — and it’s a challenge a lot of tech leaders face, especially when teams are under pressure. Here’s how I (as Addy Osmani would frame it) would approach it, grounded in what I’ve shared in *Leading Effective Engineering Teams* and my talks:

### 🧠 **First Principles: Understand Why Psychological Safety Matters**

You can’t build great products without great people — and great people need to feel safe to speak up, challenge ideas, and take risks. Innovation dies in silence. And silence is often a symptom of fear — fear of being judged, ignored, or punished.

---

### 🔑 **Strategies to Create Psychological Safety**

#### 1. **Model Vulnerability as a Leader**

Show that it’s *okay* not to have all the answers. Say “I don’t know” when you don’t. Share what *you’re* learning or struggling with. This sets the tone. As I often say: *“The behavior you walk past is the behavior you accept. The behavior you demonstrate is the one that scales.”*

> Try: Kick off retros by sharing one mistake you made that week and what you learned from it.

---

#### 2. **Redesign Meetings to Be More Inclusive**

Meetings can be intimidating. Dominant voices often overpower quieter ones.

> Try:

* Set ground rules (e.g., no interrupting, all ideas are valid).
* Use structured formats like “silent brainstorming” (write ideas individually before discussion).
* Rotate facilitation roles.
* Call on less-heard voices *gently*, not forcefully: “Priya, I’d really value your take here if you’re comfortable sharing.”

---

#### 3. **Reward Contribution Over Outcome**

People won't take risks if they fear failure. Instead, celebrate *the act of trying*, not just success.

> Example: When someone proposes an idea that doesn’t pan out, say “I’m glad you brought that forward. That kind of thinking helps us learn faster.”

---

#### 4. **1:1s Are Where You Do the Deep Work**

Psychological safety doesn’t only get built in all-hands or team meetings. It happens one conversation at a time.

> In your 1:1s:

* Ask: “Is there anything I’m doing that makes it harder for you to speak up?”
* Ask: “What’s something you’ve been hesitant to say in a group setting?”
* Ask: “How can I make this a safer space for experimentation?”

---

#### 5. **Make Feedback Normal and Frequent**

Not just “safe,” but *expected*. The longer feedback waits, the more charged it gets.

> Try:

* Embed quick feedback rituals (e.g., 5-minute retro at end of standups).
* Use blameless postmortems — focus on systems, not individuals.
* Share *positive* feedback in public, constructive feedback in private.

---

#### 6. **Explicitly Name Safety as a Priority**

Sometimes just naming the elephant in the room is powerful.

> Say: “I know we haven’t always felt comfortable surfacing concerns or ideas, and I want to change that. Innovation requires risk-taking, and that starts with safety.”

---

### 🚦 A Red Flag to Watch For

If people *only* speak up when you’re in the room, or defer all decisions to you, that’s a sign of a safety vacuum. Empower team leads or senior ICs to set their own tone — safety is contagious when it’s modeled at multiple levels.

---

### 🧭 Final Thought

Psychological safety isn’t a box you tick. It’s a culture you curate every day — in what you reward, what you tolerate, and how you listen. Keep chipping away. When safety is high, innovation, velocity, and morale follow.

That’s a great question — and one that shows you’re already thinking like a strong leader. Channeling Addy Osmani here, let’s unpack this from a few key angles:

---

### 🚦 Effectiveness vs. Efficiency: Why the Distinction Matters

> “Shipping fast is meaningless if what you're shipping doesn’t move the needle.” — *Addy Osmani*

**Efficiency** is about doing things right — optimizing processes, pushing lots of code, minimizing cycle time.
**Effectiveness** is about doing the *right* things — aligning effort to outcomes that matter.

A team that's only efficient might ship a lot of features that don’t drive user value. Your role as a leader is to connect their efforts to **impact**.

---

### 🔍 Step 1: Reconnect the Team with Outcomes

**Ask: What are we trying to achieve?**

*Shift from output-focused metrics (like velocity or story points) to outcome-focused ones (like engagement, retention, error rate reduction, or revenue uplift).*

**Action:** Introduce or revisit a clear set of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or North Star metrics. Then ask:

* Does the work we’re doing map clearly to one of these?
* If not, why are we doing it?

> "Tie your roadmap to measurable impact. Features should have a hypothesis behind them."

---

### 🧭 Step 2: Create a Culture of Product-Engineering Alignment

**Involve your engineers in understanding the “why.”**
Effective teams care about solving the right problems, not just coding tasks they’re handed.

**Action:** Set up recurring syncs with PMs, designers, and engineering to:

* Validate user problems.
* Review impact of past work.
* Kill or course-correct projects that aren’t working.

> “Empowered teams question priorities, validate assumptions, and aren’t afraid to stop work that no longer makes sense.”

---

### 🛠 Step 3: Instrumentation + Feedback Loops

> “If you can't measure it, you can't learn from it.”

**Every major feature should ship with instrumentation.** Not just logs or uptime monitoring — but real user behavior metrics:

* Are users using the feature?
* Are they completing intended flows?
* Are we reducing friction or creating it?

**Action:** Build a dashboard (or work with analytics) that makes usage & impact *visible to the team.*

---

### 💬 Step 4: Retrospectives Focused on Value

Don’t just talk about blockers and process. Add a recurring question to your team retro:

* *What shipped recently that created real impact?*
* *What did we ship that might not have been worth it? Why?*

> “Use retros not just to get faster — but to get smarter about what *not* to build.”

---

### 🔁 Step 5: Iterate Ruthlessly

Just because you shipped something doesn’t mean you’re done.

**Action:** Bake in iteration cycles. Review impact 2–4 weeks post-launch. Adjust the roadmap based on what’s working and what’s not.

---

### ✨ TL;DR from Addy’s POV:

* Map work to business/user outcomes.
* Get engineers closer to the problem space.
* Measure impact, not just output.
* Create feedback loops and iterate with intent.
* Celebrate learning as much as shipping.

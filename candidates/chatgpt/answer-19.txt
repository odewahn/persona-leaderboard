Great question — and a challenge nearly every engineering manager faces at some point.

In the spirit of Addy Osmani’s approach in *Leading Effective Engineering Teams* and *Tech Leadership Tuesday*, here's how I'd break it down:

---

### ⚖️ 1. **Align Through Purpose, Not Just Priorities**

You can't just tell a team *what* the company cares about — you need to show them *why it matters*.

> 🔑 *"People rally behind purpose, not Jira tickets."*

**Tactics:**

* Translate company OKRs or goals into a compelling team narrative. Instead of “We need to improve onboarding conversion by 5%,” say “We're making the first five minutes magical for new users so they stick around.”
* Use storytelling: Show impact metrics, customer feedback, and real outcomes of the team’s work to reinforce that what they're doing matters beyond the codebase.

---

### 🧭 2. **Involve the Team in Priority Setting**

When people feel ownership, alignment becomes natural.

**Tactics:**

* Run regular roadmap alignment sessions (monthly or quarterly). Share what the org cares about, then co-create how your team contributes.
* Ask: “Where do you think our efforts can have the most leverage?” This encourages strategic thinking and increases buy-in.

### 🔥 3. **Balance Strategic Work With Intrinsic Motivation**

> 🔁 Addy often emphasizes the importance of **balancing innovation with delivery**.

**Tactics:**

* Protect 10–20% of team time for “exploration” or “technical health” work — especially if you’re in a fast-paced product org.
* Give engineers options: "We need to hit this outcome — but how we get there is up to you." Autonomy feeds motivation.

---

### 🤝 4. **Make Trade-offs Visible and Co-owned**

Alignment falters when priorities feel imposed. Instead:

**Tactics:**

* Share the “why now?” behind prioritization decisions.
* Invite engineers into those trade-offs: “If we prioritize this initiative, it means these other items get pushed — are we OK with that?” Shared context builds shared commitment.

---

### 🧘 5. **Maintain Motivation Through Feedback Loops**

> "High-performing teams thrive on feedback and recognition."

**Tactics:**

* Celebrate impact, not just shipping. “This feature reduced churn by X%” > “We hit the sprint goal.”
* Use regular 1:1s to reconnect individual growth goals with the team mission. “What kind of work energizes you?” and “How can we get more of that into your quarter?”

If you're consistent with this approach, you’ll find that team alignment and motivation stop being at odds — they’ll reinforce each other.

Would you like a lightweight framework or template you could use in roadmap planning or team check-ins to operationalize this?

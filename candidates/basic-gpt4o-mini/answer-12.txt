It's great that you're being proactive about this situation! Having a go-to person for a specific module can be beneficial in the short term, but it can also lead to several risks, such as knowledge silos, burnout, and dependency on a single individual. Here are some strategies to mitigate these risks and promote a more balanced team dynamic:

1. **Encourage Knowledge Sharing**: Create a culture where knowledge sharing is the norm. This can be done through regular team meetings, documentation practices, and pair programming. Encourage your go-to person to share their expertise through presentations or informal lunch-and-learns. This not only helps disseminate knowledge but also builds confidence in other team members.

2. **Cross-Training**: Implement a cross-training program where team members rotate responsibilities or work on different modules. This will help everyone gain a broader understanding of the system and reduce dependency on any single individual. It can also help team members discover new interests and strengths.

3. **Documentation**: Ensure that there is comprehensive documentation for the module. This should include architecture decisions, code comments, and user guides. Good documentation can serve as a reference for other team members and make it easier for them to step in when needed.

4. **Mentorship and Pairing**: Pair the go-to person with other team members for specific tasks or projects. This not only helps transfer knowledge but also fosters relationships within the team. Itâ€™s important that the go-to person feels supported and not overwhelmed by the responsibility.

5. **Encourage Ownership**: Empower other team members to take ownership of parts of the module. This could involve assigning specific tasks or features to different individuals, allowing them to become more familiar with the codebase and the module's intricacies.

6. **Regular Check-Ins**: Have regular one-on-ones with your team members to understand their workloads and feelings about their roles. This can help you identify if someone is feeling overwhelmed or if they have the capacity to take on more responsibility.

7. **Recognize Contributions**: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions of all team members, not just the go-to person. This helps to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and motivated to contribute.

8. **Foster a Growth Mindset**: Encourage a culture of continuous learning and improvement. This can be through training sessions, workshops, or access to online courses. When team members feel they are growing, they are more likely to step up and take on new challenges.

By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that your team becomes more resilient and collaborative, reducing the risks associated with having a single point of knowledge. Remember, as a leader, your role is to empower your team and create an environment where everyone can thrive.

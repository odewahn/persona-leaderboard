Absolutely, it's great to hear that you're stepping into a leadership role! Balancing efficiency with effectiveness is crucial for any engineering team. Here are some strategies to help you ensure that your team is focusing on the right things:

### 1. **Define Clear Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**
   - Establish clear, measurable goals for your team. OKRs can help align your team's efforts with the broader objectives of the organization. Make sure these goals are ambitious yet achievable, and revisit them regularly to assess progress.

### 2. **Prioritize Work Based on Impact**
   - Use frameworks like the Eisenhower Matrix or the MoSCoW method to prioritize tasks. Focus on high-impact projects that align with your team's goals and the company's mission. Encourage your team to ask, "Is this the best use of our time?"

### 3. **Foster a Culture of Continuous Feedback**
   - Create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing feedback on processes, priorities, and outcomes. Regular retrospectives can help identify what’s working and what isn’t, allowing you to pivot as necessary.

### 4. **Encourage Cross-Functional Collaboration**
   - Engage with other teams (like product management, design, and marketing) to ensure that your engineering efforts are aligned with user needs and business goals. This collaboration can provide valuable insights into what features or improvements will have the most significant impact.

### 5. **Measure Outcomes, Not Just Output**
   - Shift the focus from lines of code or number of features delivered to the actual impact those features have on users and the business. Use metrics like user engagement, customer satisfaction, and revenue growth to gauge effectiveness.

### 6. **Invest in Team Development**
   - Encourage your team to continuously learn and grow. This could be through training, attending conferences, or working on side projects. A well-rounded team is more likely to innovate and focus on the right problems.

### 7. **Implement Agile Practices**
   - If you haven’t already, consider adopting Agile methodologies. This can help your team stay flexible and responsive to changing priorities. Regular sprints and reviews can help ensure that you’re delivering value consistently.

### 8. **Create a Vision and Communicate It**
   - Share a clear vision for where you want the team to go. This helps everyone understand the "why" behind their work and can motivate them to focus on the right priorities. Regularly communicate updates and celebrate milestones to keep the team engaged.

### 9. **Encourage Experimentation and Innovation**
   - Allow your team to explore new ideas and technologies. This can lead to innovative solutions that may not have been considered otherwise. Create a safe space for experimentation where failure is seen as a learning opportunity.

### 10. **Regularly Review and Adjust**
   - Make it a habit to regularly review your team’s focus and outcomes. Are you meeting your objectives? Are there new priorities that need to be addressed? Be willing to adjust your strategies based on what you learn.

By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that your team is not just efficient in delivering code but also effective in delivering value that aligns with your organization’s goals. Remember, the key is to maintain a balance between speed and quality, ensuring that your team is working on the right things at the right time. Good luck!

How can I improve our team's effectiveness and ensure we meet our goals?</p> <p>Absolutely, and thank you for your candor\u2014many new engineering leaders face this challenge. Drawing from my experience and the frameworks outlined in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the recent Tech Leadership Tuesday session, let\u2019s break down a practical, evidence-based approach to improving your team\u2019s effectiveness and consistently meeting deadlines.</p> <ol> <li>Build the Foundations of Team Effectiveness Start with the basics:</li> </ol> <p>Assemble the right people: Ensure your team has the right mix of skills, backgrounds, and mindsets. Diversity in experience and perspective is a strength, but clarity in roles is essential to avoid confusion and duplication of effort. Foster team spirit: Psychological safety and dependability are critical. Team members should feel comfortable taking risks and relying on each other. Recognition and open communication go a long way in building this trust . 2. Set Clear Goals and Prioritize Outcomes Shift the focus from outputs to outcomes:</p> <p>Define what success looks like: Make sure everyone understands not just what needs to be done, but why it matters. This clarity helps align efforts and motivates the team. Use goal-setting frameworks: Tools like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or SMART goals can help keep everyone on the same page and focused on business value, not just task completion . 3. Emphasize Agile and Adaptive Practices Agility is your friend:</p> <p>Adopt agile methodologies: Scrum or Kanban can help your team deliver iteratively and adapt to changing requirements. But don\u2019t follow these frameworks blindly\u2014tailor them to your team\u2019s needs. Regular check-ins: Short, focused meetings (like daily standups or weekly reviews) help surface blockers early and keep everyone aligned. Continuous improvement: Encourage the team to reflect on what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, and make small, regular adjustments . 4. Prioritize Communication and Collaboration Effective communication is non-negotiable:</p> <p>Set clear meeting objectives: Every meeting should have a purpose, an agenda, and clear action items. Promote open dialogue: Make it safe for team members to raise concerns, ask questions, and share feedback. This is especially important in remote or hybrid environments. Cross-functional collaboration: Break down silos by encouraging developers, designers, and other stakeholders to work closely together . 5. Foster Dependability and Accountability Dependability is a team sport:</p> <p>Lead by example: As a leader, model the behaviors you want to see\u2014meet your own commitments, be transparent about challenges, and follow through on promises. Promote interdependence: Encourage team members to support each other and hold each other accountable for shared goals. This builds trust and reliability, which are essential for meeting deadlines . 6. Remove Friction and Optimize Delivery Identify and address bottlenecks:</p> <p>Visualize work: Use Kanban boards or similar tools to make work-in-progress visible and limit overload. Starve problems, feed opportunities: Address obstacles quickly and look for ways to turn challenges into learning or improvement opportunities. Automate where possible: Continuous integration and delivery pipelines can reduce manual effort and speed up releases . 7. Empower and Develop Your Team Growth drives performance:</p> <p>Empower decision-making: Give team members ownership of their work and the autonomy to make decisions. Invest in learning: Provide opportunities for skill development, mentorship, and knowledge sharing. This not only improves effectiveness but also boosts morale and retention . 8. Leverage AI Thoughtfully (If Relevant) In the age of AI:</p> <p>Use AI as a tool, not a crutch: Encourage your team to use AI for prototyping or automating repetitive tasks, but ensure they understand and refine the results. Maintain code quality: Set standards for reviewing AI-generated code and foster a culture of learning and experimentation. Promote psychological safety: Address concerns about AI openly and ensure everyone feels included in the learning journey . Practical Next Steps Assess your current team structure and processes. Set or revisit your team\u2019s goals and clarify what success looks like. Introduce or refine agile practices and regular check-ins. Model and encourage open, honest communication.

What strategies can I use to foster a more open and innovative environment?</p> <p>Absolutely, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re asking this\u2014psychological safety is the foundation for high-performing, innovative engineering teams. Drawing from my experience and the frameworks outlined in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the recent Tech Leadership Tuesday session, here\u2019s a practical roadmap you can use to transform your team\u2019s environment:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Make Psychological Safety a Visible Priority Start by openly discussing the concept of psychological safety with your team. Explain that it\u2019s about creating an environment where everyone feels safe to take risks, share ideas, and admit mistakes without fear of embarrassment or retribution. This sets the tone and signals your commitment to change .</p> </li> <li> <p>Model Vulnerability and Openness As a leader, your behavior sets the standard. Share your own uncertainties, admit when you don\u2019t have all the answers, and talk about lessons learned from failures. When you do this, you normalize imperfection and encourage others to do the same .</p> </li> <li> <p>Facilitate Inclusive Discussions Rotate meeting roles (facilitator, notetaker) to give everyone a voice and distribute responsibility. Actively invite input from quieter or more junior team members. For example, after a discussion, ask, \u201cDoes anyone have a different perspective?\u201d or \u201cWhat concerns might we be missing?\u201d . Use anonymous channels (like an \u201cIdeas and Concerns\u201d forum) so even the most introverted team members can contribute without fear .</p> </li> <li>Celebrate Diverse Perspectives and Learning from Failure Acknowledge and thank team members for raising concerns or sharing unconventional ideas, even if you don\u2019t act on every suggestion. Frame failures as learning opportunities. When something doesn\u2019t work, discuss what was learned and how it will inform future work, rather than assigning blame .</li> <li>Create Dedicated Time and Space for Innovation Set aside \u201cinnovation time\u201d\u2014dedicated hours or days for team members to explore new ideas outside of regular project work. Organize brainstorming sessions or workshops where all ideas are welcome, and the focus is on quantity and creativity, not immediate feasibility .</li> <li>Build Trust and Team Spirit Encourage team bonding through informal activities, cultural exchanges, or mentorship programs. This helps break down barriers and builds mutual respect . Recognize and reward collaboration and knowledge sharing, not just individual achievement .</li> <li>Minimize Bureaucracy and Empower Decision-Making Reduce unnecessary processes that slow down experimentation. Empower team members to make decisions within their domain, signaling trust in their judgment and expertise .</li> <li>Regularly Check In and Iterate Use surveys or feedback tools (like Google\u2019s gTeams exercise) to measure psychological safety and other team dynamics. Discuss results openly and co-create action plans for improvement . Hold regular one-on-ones to understand individual concerns and aspirations, and to reinforce that their input is valued .</li> <li>Lead by Example in the Age of AI With the rise of generative AI, it\u2019s even more important to foster a culture of knowledge sharing and experimentation. Encourage your team to share both successes and failures with new tools, and remind them that everyone is learning together. This collective learning mindset is crucial for navigating rapid technological change .</li> </ol> <p>In summary, building psychological safety is an ongoing, intentional process. It requires you to model the behaviors you want to see, create structures that support open dialogue, and celebrate both the process and the outcomes of innovation. Over time, you\u2019ll see your team become more engaged, creative, and resilient. If you\u2019d like to dive deeper, we can explore how to measure psychological safety in your team, or discuss practical ways to run inclusive brainstorming sessions.

How can I create an inclusive environment that leverages our diversity effectively?</p> <p>Absolutely, I appreciate you raising this\u2014leading a diverse team is both a tremendous opportunity and a nuanced challenge. Drawing from the principles in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the recent Tech Leadership Tuesday session, let\u2019s break down actionable strategies to help you foster an inclusive, high-performing environment that truly leverages your team\u2019s diversity.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Acknowledge and Address Coordination Challenges in Diverse Teams Diversity brings a wealth of perspectives, but it can also introduce friction\u2014differences in communication styles, work habits, and even expectations around flexibility (e.g., team members with young children may need different work hours). The key is to recognize that diversity alone isn\u2019t enough; you must intentionally build an environment where everyone feels included and respected. For example, I\u2019ve seen teams where junior members hesitate to speak up, feeling overshadowed by more experienced colleagues. To counter this, I recommend structured opportunities for everyone to contribute, such as round-robin discussions or dedicated time for each voice in meetings. This not only surfaces more ideas but also builds confidence and trust across the team .</p> </li> <li> <p>Build Psychological Safety and Trust Psychological safety is the foundation of effective, inclusive teams. When team members feel safe to express ideas, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of embarrassment or retribution, you unlock their full potential. Research (including Google\u2019s Project Aristotle) shows that teams with high psychological safety are more innovative, retain talent better, and outperform their peers. As a leader, model vulnerability, thank people for raising issues, and facilitate open, judgment-free discussions. Encourage feedback and make it clear that every perspective is valued, regardless of seniority or background .</p> </li> <li> <p>Foster Inclusive Practices and Clear Communication Onboarding and Integration: Proactively welcome new team members, assign buddies or mentors, and ensure they have the resources to succeed. This helps everyone feel part of the team from day one. Role Clarity: Make sure everyone understands their responsibilities and how their work fits into the bigger picture. This reduces confusion and duplication of effort, especially important in diverse teams where assumptions may differ. Open Communication Channels: Encourage frequent, transparent communication. Use regular check-ins, open forums, and asynchronous tools to ensure everyone can participate, regardless of location or time zone .</p> </li> <li>Leverage Diversity Through Structured Collaboration Interdisciplinary Sessions: Organize regular cross-domain meetings to encourage knowledge sharing and break down silos. Rotating Roles: Allow team members to temporarily join different subteams or projects, broadening their perspectives and building empathy. Cross-Domain Initiatives: Launch projects that require collaboration between different specialties, ensuring diverse viewpoints are integrated into solutions .</li> <li>Address Unconscious Bias and Promote Inclusion Bias Training: Regularly conduct unconscious bias training and create safe spaces for open discussion about experiences and challenges. Diverse Hiring and Retention: Expand recruitment efforts to reach underrepresented groups and partner with organizations that support diversity in tech. Inclusive Culture: Celebrate differences, encourage learning from mistakes, and show genuine concern for each team member\u2019s well-being. Recognize and reward inclusive behaviors as much as technical achievements .</li> <li> <p>Empower Autonomy and Growth Give your team members autonomy to shape their work and encourage them to take ownership of their growth. Provide constructive feedback, advocate for their achievements, and support their professional development. This not only boosts morale but also helps retain diverse talent .</p> </li> <li> <p>Practical Example: Structured Meetings for Inclusion In one of my teams, we had members from four continents and a wide range of experience levels. Early meetings were dominated by a few voices. By introducing round-robin sharing and explicitly inviting input from quieter members, we saw a marked increase in engagement and the quality of ideas. Over time, this built a culture where everyone felt their contributions mattered, regardless of background or tenure .</p> </li> </ol> <p>Summary Table: Key Actions Action Area Practical Steps Psychological Safety    Model vulnerability, thank issue-raisers, facilitate open discussion Inclusive Onboarding    Assign buddies, provide resources, welcome new members Role Clarity    Define responsibilities, clarify expectations Open Communication  Use regular check-ins, open forums, async tools Cross-Team Collaboration    Interdisciplinary sessions, rotating roles, cross-domain projects Bias &amp; Inclusion    Bias training, diverse hiring, celebrate differences Empowerment &amp; Growth    Give autonomy, provide feedback, advocate for achievements</p> <p>Would you like to dive deeper into practical meeting structures for inclusion, explore ways to measure psychological safety, or discuss strategies for addressing unconscious bias within your team?

How can I ensure that we're being effective and not just efficient?</p> <p>This is a fantastic and very timely question\u2014one that every engineering leader faces, especially in fast-moving environments. Delivering a lot of code can feel productive, but as you\u2019ve sensed, output alone doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019re solving the right problems or driving meaningful impact. Let\u2019s break down how you can ensure your team is truly effective, not just efficient, drawing on the frameworks and practical advice from Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the recent Tech Leadership Tuesday session.</p> <p>Understanding Effectiveness vs. Efficiency First, it\u2019s crucial to distinguish between efficiency and effectiveness:</p> <p>Efficiency is about doing things right\u2014minimizing waste, maximizing output, and streamlining processes. For example, your team might be shipping features quickly and with clean code. Effectiveness is about doing the right things\u2014delivering outcomes that matter to your users and your business. It\u2019s not just about how much you deliver, but whether what you deliver actually solves real problems and creates value. Productivity is output over input, but it\u2019s only meaningful if the output is valuable . If your team is highly efficient but not effective, you risk building features that don\u2019t move the needle for your users or your company.</p> <p>Shifting Focus: From Output to Outcomes To ensure your team is effective:</p> <p>Align with Business and User Goals: Regularly revisit your team\u2019s objectives and ensure they map directly to business outcomes or user needs. Ask: \u201cHow does this feature or project help our users or advance our company\u2019s strategy?\u201d  Prioritize Ruthlessly: Use frameworks like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to set clear, outcome-oriented goals. This helps the team focus on what matters most, not just what\u2019s easy or interesting to build . Measure What Matters: Track metrics that reflect real impact\u2014user adoption, customer satisfaction, business KPIs\u2014not just velocity or number of pull requests . Seek Feedback Early and Often: Engage stakeholders and users throughout the development process. Their feedback is a reality check on whether you\u2019re solving the right problems . Building a Culture of Effectiveness Foster Psychological Safety: Encourage your team to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and share concerns if they feel work isn\u2019t aligned with the right goals. This openness is foundational for course-correcting early . Clarify Roles and Responsibilities: Make sure everyone knows not just what to do, but why it matters. This clarity helps avoid wasted effort and keeps the team focused . Balance Efficiency with Innovation: Streamline processes where possible, but don\u2019t over-optimize to the point that you stifle creativity or adaptability. Leave room for experimentation and learning . Practical Steps for New Leaders Here\u2019s a simple checklist to get started:</p> <p>Step    Action  Why It Matters 1   Review your team\u2019s current goals and backlog    Ensure alignment with business/user outcomes  2   Set or revisit OKRs with your team  Focus on outcomes, not just outputs  3   Implement regular stakeholder check-ins Validate you\u2019re solving the right problems  4   Track both delivery metrics and impact metrics  Balance efficiency and effectiveness  5   Encourage open discussion about priorities  Build psychological safety and adaptability </p> <p>Navigating the Age of AI If your team is leveraging AI tools, be especially mindful:</p> <p>Don\u2019t Over-Rely on AI for Output: Always verify AI-generated code and ensure it aligns with your standards and goals. Human review is essential . Maintain Critical Thinking: Encourage engineers (especially juniors) to understand and explain what AI-generated code is doing, so you don\u2019t lose sight of the \u201cwhy\u201d behind your work . Focus on Real Value: Avoid shipping features just because AI makes it easy\u2014ensure every release is genuinely useful to your users . Final Thought As a new leader, your most important job is to keep your team focused on delivering value, not just volume. By setting clear, outcome-driven goals, fostering a culture of open communication, and regularly validating your direction with stakeholders, you\u2019ll ensure your team is not just busy, but truly effective.</p> <p>If you\u2019d like to dive deeper, you might want to explore how to measure engineering effectiveness in practice or discuss strategies for focusing on the right things in engineering teams.

Let\u2019s break down how you can measure and improve both efficiency and effectiveness, while ensuring quality remains a non-negotiable part of your team\u2019s DNA.</p> <p>Measuring Efficiency vs. Effectiveness First, it\u2019s important to distinguish between these terms:</p> <p>Efficiency is about doing things right\u2014minimizing waste, maximizing output, and optimizing resource use. Typical measures include:</p> <p>Features delivered per unit of time Bug fix rate and defect density Resource utilization (time, money, personnel) Time to complete tasks or releases Effectiveness is about doing the right things\u2014delivering outcomes that matter to your users and business. Measures here include:</p> <p>Customer satisfaction (NPS, CSAT) Business value delivered (impact on KPIs) User adoption rates Return on investment (ROI) Time to market for meaningful features Productivity is a subset of efficiency, but focusing solely on output (like lines of code or story points) can be misleading. Instead, combine these metrics with outcome-based measures to get a holistic view of your team\u2019s performance. For example, tracking deployment frequency alongside customer satisfaction gives you a sense of both speed and value delivered[0][14].</p> <p>Improving Both\u2014Without Sacrificing Quality Here\u2019s how you can drive both efficiency and effectiveness, while keeping quality front and center:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Prioritize Outcomes Over Outputs Encourage your team to focus on the impact of their work, not just the volume. Make sure everyone understands how their work ties to business goals and user needs. This mindset shift helps avoid the trap of shipping features quickly that don\u2019t actually move the needle for your users or business[0][14].</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the Right Metrics Adopt a balanced scorecard approach:</p> </li> </ol> <p>For efficiency: Track cycle time, deployment frequency, bug fix rate, and resource utilization. For effectiveness: Monitor user adoption, customer feedback, and business impact metrics. For quality: Keep an eye on defect density, code review outcomes, and post-release incident rates. Regularly review these metrics together, not in isolation, to spot trade-offs or imbalances early[0][14].</p> <ol> <li> <p>Foster a Culture of Collaboration and Psychological Safety Teams that feel safe to share ideas, challenge assumptions, and learn from mistakes are more likely to innovate and maintain high standards. Psychological safety is foundational for both speed and quality\u2014people need to feel comfortable raising concerns about shortcuts or technical debt[13][14].</p> </li> <li> <p>Invest in Code Health and Technical Excellence High code quality is a force multiplier for both efficiency and effectiveness. Encourage practices like:</p> </li> </ol> <p>Regular code reviews Automated testing and CI/CD Refactoring and managing technical debt Using modern, reliable tools These reduce friction, prevent regressions, and make it easier to move quickly without breaking things[*14].</p> <ol> <li> <p>Empower and Upskill Your Team Empower team members to make decisions and take ownership. Invest in mentorship, skill development, and knowledge sharing. This not only boosts efficiency (by reducing bottlenecks) but also ensures that quality and effectiveness are sustained as your team scales[6][14].</p> </li> <li> <p>Continuously Improve Adopt a growth mindset\u2014regularly reflect on what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t.

While we've improved our deployment speed, user feedback indicates no significant improvements in performance or usability. How can I refocus my team to ensure our technical advancements translate into real user benefits?</p> <p>Absolutely, this is a scenario I\u2019ve seen play out in many high-performing teams\u2014yours is not alone. Let\u2019s break down how you can realign your team\u2019s focus so that your technical investments in microservices and Kubernetes deliver tangible value to your users.</p> <ol> <li>Recognize the Difference Between Output and Outcome</li> </ol> <p>It\u2019s common for engineering teams to celebrate technical milestones\u2014like faster deployments or a successful migration to new infrastructure. However, these are outputs, not outcomes. True effectiveness is measured by the impact on your users and the business, not just by technical achievements. In other words, efficiency (doing things right) and productivity (doing more) are important, but effectiveness (doing the right things) is what ultimately matters for your users and your organization .</p> <ol> <li>Diagnose the Disconnect</li> </ol> <p>Your team\u2019s excitement about the migration is understandable, but if users aren\u2019t experiencing better performance or usability, it\u2019s a sign that the technical work hasn\u2019t yet translated into user value. This often happens when teams focus on the \u201chow\u201d (the technology) and lose sight of the \u201cwhy\u201d (the user benefit). It\u2019s essential to step back and ask: What specific user problems were we hoping to solve with this migration? Are those problems now being addressed? </p> <ol> <li>Shift the Conversation to User Outcomes</li> </ol> <p>Refocus your team by making user outcomes the central metric of success. Here\u2019s how you can do that:</p> <p>Define Success in User Terms: Work with your product and UX partners to articulate what success looks like for your users. Is it faster load times? Fewer errors? A more intuitive workflow? Make these outcomes explicit and measurable . Measure What Matters: Move beyond technical metrics (like deployment frequency) and track user-centric metrics\u2014such as user satisfaction, adoption rates, and task completion times. These will tell you if your technical changes are making a real difference . Close the Feedback Loop: Regularly review user feedback and usage data with your team. Celebrate wins where technical changes have improved user experience, and treat gaps as opportunities for further iteration . 4. Leverage Your New Capabilities for User Value</p> <p>Now that you have a more flexible and scalable architecture, ask: How can we use this to deliver features or improvements that users will notice and appreciate? For example:</p> <p>Can you roll out performance enhancements that were previously too risky or complex? Are there new user-facing features that are now feasible because of your new architecture? Can you improve reliability or uptime in ways that directly benefit users?  5. Foster a Culture of User-Centric Engineering</p> <p>Encourage your team to think beyond the code. This means:</p> <p>Involving engineers in user research and usability testing so they see firsthand how users interact with the product. Encouraging open communication with stakeholders from product, design, and support to stay aligned on user needs . Making it a habit to ask, \u201cHow will this help our users?\u201d before starting any new technical initiative . 6. Tell the Story of Impact</p> <p>When you do deliver user-facing improvements, communicate them clearly\u2014both internally and externally. This helps reinforce the connection between technical work and user value, motivating your team and building trust with stakeholders .</p> <p>In summary, the key is to move from celebrating technical progress for its own sake to celebrating the user impact that your technical progress enables. By defining effectiveness in terms of user outcomes, measuring what matters, and fostering a culture that keeps the user at the center, you\u2019ll ensure your investments in microservices and Kubernetes pay off in ways your users will truly notice .</p> <p>If you\u2019d like to dive deeper, we could explore how to set up user-centric metrics for your team or discuss practical ways to involve engineers in user research.

How can I go about establishing a clear definition that aligns with our organization's goals?</p> <p>Absolutely, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re asking this\u2014defining effectiveness is one of the most foundational steps you can take as a new engineering leader. Let\u2019s break down a practical, evidence-based approach that you can use to set your team up for success, drawing directly from the frameworks and lessons I\u2019ve shared in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent leadership discussions.</p> <ol> <li>Start with Organizational Alignment Effectiveness isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all concept\u2014it\u2019s about \u201cdoing the right things\u201d that deliver value to your organization and its customers. The first step is to understand what success looks like for your business domain. This means:</li> </ol> <p>Reviewing your organization\u2019s mission, vision, and strategic objectives. Identifying how your team\u2019s work contributes to those broader goals. Avoiding blanket definitions\u2014tailor effectiveness to your team\u2019s context and the outcomes your organization values most . For example, if your company\u2019s top priority is customer satisfaction, your team\u2019s effectiveness might be measured by timely delivery of high-quality software that directly impacts customer experience .</p> <ol> <li>Define Team-Specific Goals and Metrics Once you have clarity on organizational objectives, cascade them down to your team:</li> </ol> <p>Set clear, specific goals for your team that are in service of the organization\u2019s priorities. Use frameworks like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or SMART goals to ensure your objectives are actionable and measurable. Identify relevant metrics\u2014these could be user adoption rates, system reliability, delivery timelines, or customer satisfaction scores, depending on your context . It\u2019s important that not every organizational OKR needs to be reflected in every team OKR, but there should be a clear connection between the two .</p> <ol> <li>Communicate and Co-Create the Definition Effectiveness should be a shared understanding, not just a top-down directive. Here\u2019s how to make it real for your team:</li> </ol> <p>Communicate your definition of effectiveness clearly and repeatedly, using multiple channels (team meetings, documentation, one-on-ones). Involve your team in refining what effectiveness means for them\u2014this builds buy-in and surfaces valuable perspectives. Provide training and context so everyone understands not just the \u201cwhat,\u201d but the \u201cwhy\u201d behind your effectiveness criteria . 4. Enable, Empower, and Expand I use the \u201c3 E\u2019s Model\u201d as a practical guide:</p> <p>Enable: Define and share what effectiveness means. Provide the knowledge, support, and tools your team needs to achieve it. Empower: Remove blockers, facilitate autonomy, and give your team the authority to make decisions that drive toward those goals. Expand: Once you have a working model, scale it\u2014apply your success patterns to other teams or broader organizational challenges . 5. Measure, Feedback, and Iterate Track progress against your defined metrics and goals. Provide timely, constructive feedback\u2014celebrate wins and address gaps. Regularly revisit and refine your definition of effectiveness as your team and organization evolve . Practical Example Suppose you\u2019re leading a platform team in a SaaS company. The organization\u2019s goal is to improve customer retention. Your team\u2019s effectiveness might be defined as:</p> <p>Reducing platform downtime by 50% over the next quarter (measured by incident reports and uptime metrics). Delivering two new features that directly address top customer pain points (measured by customer feedback and adoption rates). Improving internal developer satisfaction with platform tools (measured by internal surveys). Each of these is specific, measurable, and clearly tied to the organization\u2019s broader goal of retention.</p> <p>Key Takeaways Effectiveness = \u201cDoing the right things\u201d that deliver value to your organization and customers . Align team goals with organizational objectives using frameworks like OKRs or SMART goals . Make the definition collaborative, clear, and actionable . Use the 3 E\u2019s Model: Enable, Empower, Expand . Measure, provide feedback, and iterate .

What strategies can I use to foster autonomy and accountability?</p> <p>Empowering engineering teams to take true ownership\u2014fostering both autonomy and accountability\u2014is a central theme in Addy Osmani\u2019s Leading Effective Engineering Teams and is further explored in his recent conversation with Lena Reinhard. Drawing from these resources, here are actionable strategies, key insights, and practical examples to help you address your current challenges.</p> <ol> <li>Build a Foundation of Trust and Psychological Safety A recurring insight from Addy Osmani is that autonomy and accountability are built on trust. Teams need to feel safe to take risks, voice ideas, and learn from failures. As Osmani puts it:</li> </ol> <p>\"In a psychologically safe environment, team members feel empowered to take risks, voice their ideas and opinions openly, and view failures as valuable opportunities for growth and learning. As a leader, it is your responsibility to actively foster and maintain this type of culture, where experimentation, innovation, and continuous improvement are not only encouraged but celebrated as essential components of success.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Encourage open dialogue and regular feedback. Publicly thank team members for raising issues or surfacing problems early. Frame failures as learning opportunities, not as blameworthy events . 2. Clarify Roles, Responsibilities, and Expectations Ownership thrives when everyone knows what they are responsible for and how their work fits into the bigger picture. Osmani highlights the importance of role clarity:</p> <p>\"Role clarity can thus help to cultivate a sense of team spirit and unity if you align responsibilities with individual strengths and skills. You must also highlight the interdependence of team members\u2019 contributions, emphasizing the collaborative aspect of their work.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Define and communicate clear roles and responsibilities. Regularly review and adapt these roles as the team and projects evolve. Emphasize how each person\u2019s work contributes to team and organizational goals . 3. Delegate Authority and Avoid Micromanagement Empowerment means giving your team the authority and independence to make decisions. Osmani warns against micromanagement, which stifles both autonomy and innovation:</p> <p>\"Certain managers tell their teams exactly how to execute tasks rather than highlighting what needs to be done. This approach stifles the team\u2019s autonomy and creativity and hampers their ability to find innovative solutions.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Focus on outcomes, not prescribing every step. Delegate meaningful responsibilities and let team members lead initiatives or meetings. Provide support and resources, but step back to let the team own the process . 4. Foster Accountability Through Clear Goals and Feedback Accountability is not about blame, but about clarity and follow-through. Osmani recommends:</p> <p>\"Hold leaders accountable for driving improvements and making decisions contributing to the team\u2019s growth and success... Fostering a proactive and engaged leadership style that provides clear direction, gives actionable feedback, and embraces change is essential for creating a dynamic and thriving team environment.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Set clear, measurable goals and regularly review progress. Provide constructive, actionable feedback. Celebrate ownership and initiative, and address issues directly but supportively . 5. Encourage Autonomy with Support and Growth Opportunities Autonomy is most effective when paired with support and opportunities for growth. Osmani\u2019s \u201cfeed opportunities, starve problems\u201d principle is especially relevant:</p> <p>\"Empowering grants individuals or teams the authority, independence, and trust to take ownership of their work and make decisions. It emphasizes giving individuals the power, confidence, and freedom to act independently and be accountable for their actions and outcomes.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Assign projects that align with team members\u2019 strengths and interests. Offer training, mentorship, and cross-functional collaboration opportunities. Encourage experimentation and risk-taking, rewarding learning and adaptability . 6. Leverage Team Rituals and Agile Practices Agile methodologies and regular team rituals (like retrospectives and stand-ups) can reinforce both autonomy and accountability:</p> <p>Use retrospectives to reflect on what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, and let the team propose and own improvements. Implement agile practices that encourage self-organization and iterative delivery . 7. Address Antipatterns and Continuously Improve Be vigilant for leadership and process antipatterns that undermine ownership, such as passive leadership or unclear workflows. Osmani notes:</p> <p>\"By recognizing the signs of individual antipatterns, such as over-helping or trivial tweaking, teams can promote healthier collaboration and growth... Leadership antipatterns, like skeptical or passive leadership, remind us of the importance of active, empowering, and communicative leadership to steer projects toward success.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <ol> <li>In the Age of AI: Balance Human Judgment and Automation In the context of generative AI, Osmani and Reinhard emphasize not letting AI tools bypass learning or ownership:</li> </ol> <p>\"You can have juniors also attempt to solve tasks manually before using AI to automate it or to check or refine their work... It's really about just setting this culture within your team about not using AI as a crutch, but as something that will maybe help us with velocity, but it doesn't remove the need for us to learn and to understand. So treat it as a learning tool.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Tech Leadership Tuesday with Lena Reinhard </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Use AI to augment, not replace, critical thinking and collaboration. Pair juniors and seniors in exercises where AI is a tool, not the solution. Maintain high standards for code quality and learning, even as you adopt new technologies . Summary Table: Strategies for Fostering Autonomy &amp; Accountability Strategy    Practical Actions   Key Resource(s) Build psychological safety  Encourage open feedback, celebrate learning from failure   Clarify roles and responsibilities  Define, communicate, and adapt roles; show interdependence Delegate and avoid micromanagement  Focus on outcomes, let team lead, provide support  Set clear goals and feedback loops  Measurable goals, regular reviews, constructive feedback   Empower with support and growth Assign by strengths, offer training, encourage experimentation Use agile and team rituals  Retrospectives, stand-ups, self-organization   Address antipatterns    Identify and correct passive or unclear leadership/processes   Balance AI with human learning  Use AI as a tool, not a crutch; pair learning with automation   </p> <p>Would you like to dive deeper into practical examples of role clarity and ownership, or explore how to measure the impact of these strategies on team performance?

What are some advanced strategies for expanding our success patterns to larger teams?</p> <p>Absolutely, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re thinking about scaling your team\u2019s effectiveness across the organization. Drawing from my experience and the frameworks I\u2019ve shared in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent discussions on Tech Leadership Tuesday, here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach expanding your success patterns to larger teams:</p> <ol> <li>Leverage the 3 E\u2019s Model: Enable, Empower, Expand Scaling effectiveness starts with a repeatable model. The 3 E\u2019s\u2014Enable, Empower, Expand\u2014provide a structured approach:</li> </ol> <p>Enable: Clearly define what effectiveness means for your teams and organization. This isn\u2019t just about output, but about aligning on value, outcomes, and the metrics that matter for your business context. Share these definitions and aspirations widely so everyone is moving in the same direction. Empower: Remove blockers and delegate decision-making. As your teams grow, you can\u2019t be the bottleneck. Empower team leads and ICs to own decisions, and invest in mentorship so that knowledge and context are distributed, not centralized. Expand: Once you have a pattern that works for one team, adapt and scale it. This means making teams self-sufficient, then applying those success patterns\u2014like effective communication rituals, code review standards, or onboarding processes\u2014across other teams, with tweaks as needed for context. Always ensure alignment with organizational goals as you scale up . 2. Build a Culture of Continuous Improvement and Psychological Safety Continuous Improvement: Encourage teams to regularly reflect on what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. Use retrospectives and feedback loops to surface and address antipatterns\u2014like over-helping, trivial tweaking, or passive leadership\u2014that can undermine effectiveness at scale. This creates a culture where learning and adaptation are the norm, not the exception . Psychological Safety: As teams grow, maintaining psychological safety becomes more challenging but even more critical. People need to feel safe to share ideas, raise concerns, and admit mistakes. This is foundational for innovation and for scaling success patterns, especially in environments where ambiguity and change are constant . 3. Optimize Team Structure and Communication Right Team Size: Research and experience show that smaller teams (ideally under 10) are more effective, but as you scale, you\u2019ll need to manage the complexity of more communication links. Use sub-teams, clear interfaces, and strong leads to keep communication efficient and avoid coordination overhead . Diversity and Inclusion: Diverse teams are more innovative, but only if you foster an inclusive environment. As you scale, be intentional about supporting flexible work arrangements and ensuring all voices are heard, which helps avoid coordination breakdowns and unlocks the benefits of diversity . 4. Codify and Share Success Patterns Document and Share: When you find rituals, processes, or tools that work\u2014whether it\u2019s a code review checklist, onboarding playbook, or incident response protocol\u2014document them and make them accessible. Encourage teams to adapt these patterns, not just adopt them blindly. Case Studies and Storytelling: Share real-world examples of what\u2019s worked (and what hasn\u2019t) across teams. This helps others learn from both successes and failures, and builds a shared language for effectiveness . 5. Leadership Multiplication and High-Leverage Activities Multiply Leadership: Invest in developing new leaders. As you scale, you need more people who can model and propagate your success patterns. This means coaching, mentoring, and giving emerging leaders real responsibility. Focus on High-Leverage Activities: Identify and prioritize the activities that have the biggest impact on effectiveness\u2014like improving onboarding, automating repetitive tasks, or refining your incident response. Feed opportunities and starve problems by focusing resources where they\u2019ll make the most difference . 6. Adapt to the Age of AI Integrate AI Thoughtfully: As discussed in the Tech Leadership Tuesday session, AI tools can boost productivity, but they also introduce new challenges\u2014like ensuring code quality and maintaining mentorship for junior engineers. Be intentional about how you introduce AI, measure its impact, and ensure it augments rather than replaces the learning and collaboration that drive long-term effectiveness . Maintain Human Connection: Even as you scale and adopt new tools, prioritize human connection, creativity, and critical thinking. Don\u2019t let AI or process become a substitute for thoughtful leadership and real user value . 7. Always Be Scaling\u2014But Thoughtfully The \u201cThree Always\u201d of Leadership: Always be deciding, always be leaving (creating space for others to step up), and always be scaling. This mindset ensures you\u2019re not just growing for growth\u2019s sake, but scaling what works, evolving what doesn\u2019t, and building an organization that can adapt to new challenges .

What strategies can I use to improve my feedback skills?</p> <p>Absolutely, and thank you for your candor\u2014struggling with feedback is a common challenge for new engineering managers, and it\u2019s a skill that pays dividends for both your team\u2019s growth and your own leadership journey. Drawing from my experience and the frameworks I\u2019ve shared in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent discussions on Tech Leadership Tuesday, here\u2019s a practical, research-backed approach to help you level up your feedback skills:</p> <ol> <li>Make Feedback Regular, Structured, and Actionable Establish a Feedback Rhythm: Don\u2019t wait for annual reviews. Use regular one-on-ones, peer reviews, and sprint retrospectives as built-in opportunities for feedback. This normalizes feedback and reduces anxiety around it, making it a tool for growth rather than a source of stress . Be Specific and Actionable: Vague feedback (\u201cdo better next time\u201d) is rarely helpful. Instead, cite concrete examples and focus on observable behaviors. For instance, \u201cIn the last code review, I noticed you caught a critical bug\u2014great attention to detail. One area to work on is documenting your thought process so others can follow your logic more easily\u201d . Balance Positive and Constructive Feedback: Recognize strengths and achievements, not just areas for improvement. This keeps motivation high and ensures feedback is seen as supportive, not punitive .</li> <li>Tailor Feedback to the Individual Understand Individual Needs: Each team member has unique goals, learning styles, and sensitivities. Adapt your feedback style accordingly\u2014some may prefer directness, others may need more context or encouragement . Ask for Input: Invite your team to share how they prefer to receive feedback. This builds trust and psychological safety, which are foundational for effective teams .</li> <li>Foster a Culture of Continuous Improvement Encourage Peer Feedback: Create opportunities for team members to review each other\u2019s work. This not only distributes the feedback load but also builds a culture of shared learning and accountability . Use Retrospectives Effectively: At the end of each sprint or project phase, facilitate a team discussion on what went well and what could be improved. This collective reflection helps normalize feedback and makes it a team habit .</li> <li>Follow Up and Support Growth Check In on Progress: Feedback shouldn\u2019t be a one-off event. Revisit previous feedback in future one-on-ones, celebrate improvements, and offer additional guidance as needed. This shows you\u2019re invested in their development . Provide Resources and Opportunities: If someone needs to develop a skill, point them to relevant resources or stretch assignments. Feedback is most effective when paired with support .</li> <li>Model Openness and Vulnerability Seek Feedback Yourself: Ask your team for feedback on your own management style. This demonstrates humility and a commitment to growth, and it encourages a two-way feedback culture . Acknowledge Uncertainty: Especially in fast-changing environments (like those shaped by generative AI), be transparent about what you know and what you\u2019re still figuring out. This builds trust and psychological safety .

How can I foster an environment where team members feel safe to express their ideas and concerns?</p> <p>Ensuring psychological safety in a large engineering team is foundational for innovation, engagement, and long-term success. Drawing from Addy Osmani\u2019s Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the live event Tech Leadership Tuesday with Lena Reinhard: Leading Effective Engineering Teams in the Age of Generative AI with Addy Osmani, here are actionable strategies and key insights to help you foster an environment where team members feel genuinely safe to express their ideas and concerns.</p> <p>Key Insights &amp; Practical Strategies 1. Model and Nurture Psychological Safety As Addy Osmani emphasizes in Leading Effective Engineering Teams:</p> <p>\u201cAs a team leader, you must nurture psychological safety so that team members feel safe speaking up, taking risks, and admitting mistakes. Creating psychological safety in a tech team setting involves proactive measures by the leader. Great leaders allow unconventional ideas and celebrate failures as learning opportunities. This environment fosters creative thinking without fear of embarrassment.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Publicly thank team members for raising concerns or sharing ideas, especially when they challenge the status quo. Facilitate open, nonjudgmental discussions and ask open-ended questions to encourage broader participation. Celebrate learning from failures, not just successes, to normalize risk-taking and experimentation. 2. Encourage Open Communication and Inclusive Dialogue \u201cAvoid monopolizing discussions and allow team members to speak. Foster an environment where all team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas, questions, and concerns. Encourage active participation, constructive contributions, and open dialogue, especially from remote team members.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Rotate meeting roles (facilitator, notetaker) to distribute responsibility and give everyone a voice. Use anonymous forums or regular \u201cIdeas and Concerns\u201d sessions to surface input from quieter or more introverted team members. Pair junior members with senior mentors to bridge experience gaps and foster trust. 3. Build an Inclusive and Supportive Team Culture \u201cA good manager understands that to create an inclusive team environment, one has to show concern for success and well-being. They create a safe space for team members to share their ideas and opinions, encourage them to think creatively and solve problems, show concern for the health of colleagues by offering support if they\u2019re having personal issues, encourage team members to learn from mistakes without judgment, and take time to get to know each team member personally.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Proactively welcome new team members and assign buddies for onboarding. Regularly check in on team members\u2019 well-being, not just their work output. Recognize and celebrate cultural and individual differences through team rituals or \u201ccultural exchange\u201d meetups. 4. Approach Conflict as a Collaborator, Not an Adversary \u201cApproach conflict as a collaborator, not an adversary. Look at conflicts optimistically as opportunities for growth and learning. Instead of taking sides or assigning blame, managers should facilitate open and respectful discussions where all parties involved can express their perspectives.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Frame disagreements as opportunities for collective problem-solving. Use language that is empathetic and inclusive\u2014\u201cspeak human to human.\u201d Anticipate reactions to sensitive topics and plan supportive responses. 5. Maintain High Standards Alongside Psychological Safety \u201cManagers who want to foster psychological safety in their teams must understand that doing so does not mean relaxing performance standards. You cannot allow inappropriate conduct just to ensure team members feel safe. Performance standards and psychological safety must both be high for people to speak up and voice concerns.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Set clear expectations for both behavior and results. Address issues constructively and fairly, ensuring accountability without blame. Reinforce that psychological safety is about enabling high performance, not avoiding difficult conversations. 6. Adapting to the Age of AI and Change In the context of generative AI and rapid technological change, Lena Reinhard and Addy Osmani highlight:</p> <p>\u201cLearn techniques for building psychological safety when introducing AI tools and managing team concerns about AI's impact on their roles... preserving human connection and creativity while integrating powerful new capabilities.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani &amp; Lena Reinhard, Tech Leadership Tuesday with Lena Reinhard: Leading Effective Engineering Teams in the Age of Generative AI with Addy Osmani </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Be transparent about how new tools (like AI) will impact workflows and roles.

How can I ensure that this doesn't become a problem for the team?</p> <p>Absolutely, this is a classic scenario that many engineering leaders encounter, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re spotting it early. When a single team member becomes the \u201cgo-to\u201d expert for a module, it can create a single point of failure and lead to knowledge silos\u2014both of which can undermine your team\u2019s resilience and long-term effectiveness. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach this, drawing on the principles and real-world strategies I\u2019ve shared in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent leadership discussions :</p> <p>Why This Is a Problem When one person holds all the knowledge about a module, several risks emerge:</p> <p>Single Point of Failure: If that person is unavailable (vacation, illness, or leaves the company), progress can stall or critical issues may go unresolved. Knowledge Silos: Other team members miss out on learning opportunities, and the team\u2019s collective problem-solving ability is diminished. Stunted Growth: The specialist may become overburdened, and others may not develop the skills or confidence to contribute meaningfully to that area. Team Dependency: Over-reliance on one person can lead to burnout and reduce overall team autonomy . Practical Steps to Distribute Knowledge and Reduce Risk Here\u2019s a set of actionable strategies you can implement:</p> <ol> <li>Encourage Cross-Training and Pair Programming Pair the module expert with other engineers on tasks, code reviews, or bug fixes related to the module. Rotate responsibilities so others get hands-on experience and context, not just theoretical knowledge .</li> <li>Promote Documentation and Knowledge Sharing Ask the expert to document exceptional cases, FAQs, and the rationale behind key decisions in the module. Organize regular knowledge-sharing sessions or internal tech talks where the expert walks the team through the module\u2019s architecture, common pitfalls, and best practices .</li> <li>Foster a Culture of Collaboration Encourage open communication and a \u201cno-blame\u201d environment where team members feel safe to ask questions and admit what they don\u2019t know. Reward teamwork and knowledge sharing, not just individual heroics .</li> <li>Mentorship and Peer Learning Set up mentorship or buddy systems, pairing less experienced team members with the expert for onboarding or specific projects. Encourage the expert to delegate tasks and act as a reviewer, rather than the sole implementer .</li> <li>Monitor and Adjust During one-on-ones, check in with both the expert and other team members about their learning goals and comfort level with the module. Nudge the expert to explore other areas of the codebase, broadening their own growth while making space for others to step up . Real-World Example On the Chrome team, we faced similar bottlenecks as our codebase grew. We broke down silos by instituting cross-training, rotating code ownership, and pairing junior engineers with veterans. This not only distributed expertise but also scaled our team\u2019s capabilities without increasing headcount .</li> </ol> <p>The Goal Aim for a \u201chigh bus factor\u201d\u2014meaning, if any one person were to leave, the project would continue smoothly. Ideally, every expert should have at least one or two backups who are 60\u201380% as knowledgeable as they are about the module .</p> <p>Would you like to dive deeper into practical ways to run knowledge-sharing sessions, or perhaps explore how to motivate specialists to share their expertise?

How can I help them focus and develop expertise?</p> <p>Absolutely, this is a common challenge in high-performing engineering teams, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re proactively seeking to support your engineer\u2019s growth. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach this, drawing on the frameworks and practical advice from Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent leadership discussions:</p> <ol> <li>Recognize the \u201cGeneralist\u201d Antipattern When an engineer spreads themselves too thin across multiple domains, they risk becoming a \u201cgeneralist\u201d without true mastery in any area. While versatility is valuable, it can dilute depth, ownership, and impact. You\u2019ll often notice that such engineers are involved everywhere, but their contributions lack the depth needed for critical problem-solving or innovation. Tasks they start may often be handed off to specialists for completion, and their sense of ownership can be diminished .</li> </ol> <p>Action:</p> <p>Have a candid conversation with the engineer about the value of developing a T-shaped skill set: deep expertise in one area (the vertical bar of the T) while maintaining the ability to collaborate across domains (the horizontal bar) . 2. Guide Them to Focus on High-Impact Areas Encourage the engineer to identify where their unique strengths and interests align with the team\u2019s most critical needs. Ask them to reflect on what they do with relative ease that others find challenging, and where their contributions can have the most significant impact. Concentration\u2014doing one major thing at a time\u2014is the secret to effectiveness in engineering .</p> <p>Action:</p> <p>Work together to select one or two key areas for them to focus on, ideally where their strengths and the team\u2019s priorities intersect. Set clear, measurable goals for deepening expertise in these areas. 3. Structure Opportunities for Mastery Support their development by providing structured opportunities to build depth:</p> <p>Assign them ownership of a specific module or project area. Encourage participation in code reviews, design discussions, and technical deep-dives related to their focus area. Schedule regular check-ins to discuss progress, challenges, and learning goals . Action:</p> <p>Recommend they dedicate time each week to hands-on work, learning, and reflection in their chosen area. Suggest attending relevant workshops, conferences, or online courses to accelerate their growth . 4. Foster a Culture of Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration Encourage the engineer to share their learning journey with the team\u2014through documentation, tech talks, or mentoring others. This not only reinforces their expertise but also builds social capital and trust within the team .</p> <p>Action:</p> <p>Pair them with a mentor or senior engineer who can provide guidance and feedback. Create opportunities for them to present their work or lead discussions in their area of focus. 5. Regularly Revisit and Adjust Growth is iterative. Check in regularly to ensure the engineer feels challenged but not overwhelmed, and that their focus area remains aligned with both their aspirations and the team\u2019s evolving needs .</p> <p>Action:</p> <p>Use one-on-ones to discuss their progress, celebrate milestones, and adjust focus as needed. Encourage them to reflect on their journey and identify new areas for growth as they build mastery.

This broadens their understanding and skill set, making the team more adaptive and resilient. Rotate responsibilities periodically. This ensures that knowledge is spread and not owned by just a few individuals. For example, have engineers take turns owning different modules or features for a sprint or quarter .</li> <li>Structured Knowledge Sharing Regular knowledge-sharing sessions: Host internal tech talks, brown bags, or \u201clunch and learns\u201d where team members present on their areas of expertise or recent challenges they\u2019ve solved. Pair programming: Pair experienced engineers with less experienced ones to foster mutual learning and break down silos . Mentorship programs: Pair new or junior engineers with veterans to accelerate onboarding and institutionalize expertise .</li> <li>Documentation and Code Ownership Encourage specialists to document exceptional cases, FAQs, and architectural decisions. This makes critical knowledge accessible to everyone. Share code ownership: Avoid \u201ccode islands\u201d by ensuring multiple people are familiar with each major component. Use code reviews as a learning opportunity, not just a gatekeeping mechanism .</li> <li>Cultural Practices Promote a culture of open communication and psychological safety. As I noted in the book, teams that trust each other and feel safe asking questions are less likely to develop silos: \u201cOpen communication, shared knowledge, and a culture of collaboration can turn a team of individuals into a cohesive unit, producing outstanding results.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </li> </ol> <p>Reward teamwork and collaboration: Recognize and celebrate when team members help each other or share knowledge, not just when they deliver individually . 5. Leadership Nudges Ask about learning goals in 1:1s: Regularly check in with your specialists about their aspirations and encourage them to expand their expertise into adjacent areas . Delegate and review: Have specialists delegate some of their changes to others, taking on a reviewer role to build up others\u2019 expertise . Lessons from the Field In my early days leading the Chrome team, we faced exactly these challenges. As the codebase grew, a few engineers became the go-to experts for certain components, creating bottlenecks. We broke these down by:</p> <p>Instituting cross-training and rotation programs Pairing junior engineers with veterans Encouraging more documentation and internal tech talks This approach \u201ccommoditized and institutionalized\u201d expertise, scaling our team\u2019s capabilities without increasing headcount .</p> <p>The Role of AI in Knowledge Sharing In the age of generative AI, there\u2019s a new layer to consider. As I discussed with Lena Reinhard:</p> <p>\u201cTeams will also need to start to think more about good knowledge-sharing protocols to address those risks of understanding how components or apps are built, staying in the AI\u2019s head. Because if you mostly just prompted your way to a solution and you sent it over as a pull request, you have to make sure that you\u2019re also thinking about the long term. Who\u2019s going to maintain the code? Do they understand how it works? Do we have documentation?\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Tech Leadership Tuesday with Lena Reinhard: Leading Effective Engineering Teams in the Age of Generative AI </p> <p>So, as you integrate AI tools, double down on documentation, code reviews, and mentorship to ensure that wledge generated (or accelerated) by AI is truly shared and understood by the team.</p> <p>Closing Thoughts Preventing knowledge silos and distributing expertise is an ongoing leadership responsibility. It\u2019s about building a culture where learning, sharing, and collaboration are the norm\u2014not the exception.

This is a common and important question, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re asking it early in your journey. Let\u2019s break down the distinction between leadership and management, and then explore how you can balance both for your team\u2019s success.</p> <p>Leadership vs. Management: What\u2019s the Difference? Management is fundamentally about planning, organizing, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. It\u2019s the operational side of your role\u2014setting timelines, allocating resources, ensuring processes run smoothly, and solving day-to-day problems. Think of management as the engine that keeps the train running on time and on the right track.</p> <p>Leadership, on the other hand, is about setting direction, inspiring, and motivating people. It\u2019s less about the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow,\u201d and more about the \u201cwhy.\u201d Leaders create a vision, align people around that vision, and empower them to achieve more than they thought possible. Leadership is about change, movement, and growth\u2014helping your team adapt, innovate, and reach new heights.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a quick comparison to clarify the distinction:</p> <p>Leadership  Management Establishes direction and vision    Plans and budgets Aligns and inspires people  Organizes and staffs Motivates and empowers  Controls and problem-solves Drives change and innovation    Maintains order and consistency</p> <p>Both are essential. Leadership without management can lead to chaos; management without leadership can lead to stagnation. The most effective engineering leaders blend both skill sets seamlessly .</p> <p>Balancing Leadership and Management in Your Team 1. Shift from \u201cMe\u201d to \u201cWe\u201d As you transition from an individual contributor to a leader, your impact is no longer measured by your own output, but by the collective success of your team. Focus on enabling others, sharing knowledge, and lifting those around you. This mindset shift is foundational .</p> <ol> <li> <p>Prioritize People Over Technical Tasks It\u2019s tempting to stay hands-on with code, but your primary responsibility is now to support, mentor, and develop your team. Invest time in one-on-ones, team meetings, and cross-team collaboration. Let go of the urge to micromanage technical details\u2014empower your team to own solutions .</p> </li> <li> <p>Communicate Vision and Set Clear Expectations As a leader, articulate a compelling vision and ensure everyone understands how their work contributes to it. As a manager, translate that vision into actionable plans, clear goals, and well-defined roles. Regularly check in to keep everyone aligned .</p> </li> <li> <p>Foster Psychological Safety and Trust Especially in times of change (like integrating AI tools), create an environment where team members feel safe to ask questions, share concerns, and experiment. This is a core leadership responsibility that also supports effective management .</p> </li> <li> <p>Adapt and Evolve The landscape is always shifting\u2014whether it\u2019s new technology, changing business needs, or team dynamics. Be ready to adapt your approach, combining the stability of management with the flexibility and inspiration of leadership .</p> </li> </ol> <p>Practical Tips for Day-to-Day Balance Delegate technical tasks to your team, but stay close enough to understand challenges and provide guidance. Schedule regular one-on-ones to mentor and coach, not just to check on progress. Use structured meetings for planning and problem-solving, but also carve out time for vision-setting and team-building. Solicit feedback from your team and peers\u2014leadership is a continuous learning process. Celebrate wins and learn from failures together, reinforcing both accountability (management) and growth (leadership). Balancing leadership and management is a journey, not a destination. The best leaders I\u2019ve seen are those who regularly reflect, seek feedback, and are willing to adapt. If you\u2019re interested in diving deeper, you might want to explore how to build psychological safety or navigate the transition from engineer to manager in your own context.</p> <p>Let me know if you\u2019d like to discuss specific scenarios or challenges you\u2019re facing\u2014I\u2019m here to help you grow into a confident, effective leader.</p>"},{"location":"answers-v3/#question-19","title":"Question 19","text":"Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.6055 0.9954 <p>Answers v3 (Miso Studio) | As an engineering manager, I find it challenging to align my team with organizational priorities while maintaining their motivation. What strategies can I use to achieve this balance?</p> <p>Absolutely, this is a challenge every engineering leader faces\u2014aligning teams with organizational priorities without sacrificing motivation or engagement. Drawing from the frameworks and practical advice in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the recent Tech Leadership Tuesday session, here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach this as your mentor:</p> <ol> <li>Translate Vision into Tangible Goals Start by breaking down the company\u2019s vision and strategy into clear, measurable goals for your team. This means not just sharing the \u201cwhat\u201d but also the \u201cwhy\u201d\u2014helping each team member see how their work ladders up to the broader mission. Use frameworks like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to create a direct line of sight between individual tasks and organizational objectives. When people understand the impact of their work, motivation naturally increases .</li> </ol> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Set quarterly OKRs that connect to at least one higher-level company objective. Regularly review progress and celebrate milestones to reinforce the connection between effort and impact . 2. Foster a Shared Mindset and Psychological Safety A high-performing team thrives on psychological safety and a shared sense of purpose. Encourage open communication, where team members feel safe to share ideas, voice concerns, and even challenge decisions. This not only surfaces better solutions but also builds trust and engagement .</p> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Hold regular brainstorming sessions and check-ins. Share user personas, mock-ups, or customer feedback to make the \u201cwhy\u201d behind priorities tangible. Model vulnerability and openness as a leader, especially when introducing new tools or changes (such as GenAI) . 3. Involve the Team in Shaping the Path Motivation soars when people feel ownership. Involve your team in shaping how you\u2019ll achieve organizational goals. Solicit their input on priorities, process improvements, and even the adoption of new technologies like generative AI. This collaborative approach not only surfaces valuable insights but also increases buy-in .</p> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Co-create the team\u2019s vision and strategy where possible. Encourage team members to propose and lead initiatives aligned with company goals. 4. Communicate Relentlessly and Transparently Consistent, transparent communication is the glue that keeps alignment and motivation strong. Regularly update your team on how their work is moving the needle, what\u2019s changing at the organizational level, and why certain priorities are shifting. This helps reduce uncertainty and keeps everyone focused .</p> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Share context for tasks, not just assignments. Discuss both achievements and challenges openly. Explain the rationale behind changes in direction or strategy. 5. Empower and Unblock Empower your team by removing obstacles and giving them autonomy within clear boundaries. Make sure they have the resources, support, and clarity needed to execute. When people feel trusted and supported, they\u2019re more likely to stay motivated\u2014even when priorities shift .</p> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Actively identify and remove roadblocks. Delegate ownership of key areas, making roles and responsibilities explicit. 6. Balance AI Adoption with Human Growth In the age of generative AI, it\u2019s crucial to ensure that new tools enhance\u2014not bypass\u2014learning and collaboration. Use AI to augment productivity, but also invest in mentorship and knowledge sharing so that all team members, regardless of experience, continue to grow .</p> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Pair junior and senior developers on AI-augmented projects. Maintain code quality standards and review processes, even when using AI-generated solutions. 7. Celebrate Impact and Progress Finally, regularly highlight the real-world impact of your team\u2019s work\u2014whether through customer stories, product metrics, or internal wins. Recognition fuels motivation and reinforces the value of aligning with organizational goals .</p> <p>Would you like to dive deeper into practical OKR implementation, explore psychological safety techniques, or discuss balancing AI adoption with team development in more detail?

Diversity in experience and perspective is a strength, but clarity in roles is essential to avoid confusion and duplication of effort. Foster team spirit: Psychological safety and dependability are critical. Team members should feel comfortable taking risks and relying on each other. Recognition and open communication go a long way in building this trust . 2. Set Clear Goals and Prioritize Outcomes Shift the focus from outputs to outcomes:</p> <p>Define what success looks like: Make sure everyone understands not just what needs to be done, but why it matters. This clarity helps align efforts and motivates the team. Use goal-setting frameworks: Tools like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or SMART goals can help keep everyone on the same page and focused on business value, not just task completion . 3. Emphasize Agile and Adaptive Practices Agility is your friend:</p> <p>Adopt agile methodologies: Scrum or Kanban can help your team deliver iteratively and adapt to changing requirements. But don\u2019t follow these frameworks blindly\u2014tailor them to your team\u2019s needs. Regular check-ins: Short, focused meetings (like daily standups or weekly reviews) help surface blockers early and keep everyone aligned. Continuous improvement: Encourage the team to reflect on what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, and make small, regular adjustments . 4. Prioritize Communication and Collaboration Effective communication is non-negotiable:</p> <p>Set clear meeting objectives: Every meeting should have a purpose, an agenda, and clear action items. Promote open dialogue: Make it safe for team members to raise concerns, ask questions, and share feedback. This is especially important in remote or hybrid environments. Cross-functional collaboration: Break down silos by encouraging developers, designers, and other stakeholders to work closely together . 5. Foster Dependability and Accountability Dependability is a team sport:</p> <p>Lead by example: As a leader, model the behaviors you want to see\u2014meet your own commitments, be transparent about challenges, and follow through on promises. Promote interdependence: Encourage team members to support each other and hold each other accountable for shared goals. This builds trust and reliability, which are essential for meeting deadlines . 6. Remove Friction and Optimize Delivery Identify and address bottlenecks:</p> <p>Visualize work: Use Kanban boards or similar tools to make work-in-progress visible and limit overload. Starve problems, feed opportunities: Address obstacles quickly and look for ways to turn challenges into learning or improvement opportunities. Automate where possible: Continuous integration and delivery pipelines can reduce manual effort and speed up releases . 7. Empower and Develop Your Team Growth drives performance:</p> <p>Empower decision-making: Give team members ownership of their work and the autonomy to make decisions. Invest in learning: Provide opportunities for skill development, mentorship, and knowledge sharing. This not only improves effectiveness but also boosts morale and retention . 8. Leverage AI Thoughtfully (If Relevant) In the age of AI:</p> <p>Use AI as a tool, not a crutch: Encourage your team to use AI for prototyping or automating repetitive tasks, but ensure they understand and refine the results. Maintain code quality: Set standards for reviewing AI-generated code and foster a culture of learning and experimentation. Promote psychological safety: Address concerns about AI openly and ensure everyone feels included in the learning journey . Practical Next Steps Assess your current team structure and processes. Set or revisit your team\u2019s goals and clarify what success looks like. Introduce or refine agile practices and regular check-ins. Model and encourage open, honest communication. Visualize work and address bottlenecks proactively. Invest in your team\u2019s growth and celebrate wins, big or small.

Drawing from my experience and the frameworks outlined in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the recent Tech Leadership Tuesday session, here\u2019s a practical roadmap you can use to transform your team\u2019s environment:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Make Psychological Safety a Visible Priority Start by openly discussing the concept of psychological safety with your team. Explain that it\u2019s about creating an environment where everyone feels safe to take risks, share ideas, and admit mistakes without fear of embarrassment or retribution. This sets the tone and signals your commitment to change .</p> </li> <li> <p>Model Vulnerability and Openness As a leader, your behavior sets the standard. Share your own uncertainties, admit when you don\u2019t have all the answers, and talk about lessons learned from failures. When you do this, you normalize imperfection and encourage others to do the same .</p> </li> <li> <p>Facilitate Inclusive Discussions Rotate meeting roles (facilitator, notetaker) to give everyone a voice and distribute responsibility. Actively invite input from quieter or more junior team members. For example, after a discussion, ask, \u201cDoes anyone have a different perspective?\u201d or \u201cWhat concerns might we be missing?\u201d . Use anonymous channels (like an \u201cIdeas and Concerns\u201d forum) so even the most introverted team members can contribute without fear .</p> </li> <li>Celebrate Diverse Perspectives and Learning from Failure Acknowledge and thank team members for raising concerns or sharing unconventional ideas, even if you don\u2019t act on every suggestion. Frame failures as learning opportunities. When something doesn\u2019t work, discuss what was learned and how it will inform future work, rather than assigning blame .</li> <li>Create Dedicated Time and Space for Innovation Set aside \u201cinnovation time\u201d\u2014dedicated hours or days for team members to explore new ideas outside of regular project work. Organize brainstorming sessions or workshops where all ideas are welcome, and the focus is on quantity and creativity, not immediate feasibility .</li> <li>Build Trust and Team Spirit Encourage team bonding through informal activities, cultural exchanges, or mentorship programs. This helps break down barriers and builds mutual respect . Recognize and reward collaboration and knowledge sharing, not just individual achievement .</li> <li>Minimize Bureaucracy and Empower Decision-Making Reduce unnecessary processes that slow down experimentation. Empower team members to make decisions within their domain, signaling trust in their judgment and expertise .</li> <li>Regularly Check In and Iterate Use surveys or feedback tools (like Google\u2019s gTeams exercise) to measure psychological safety and other team dynamics. Discuss results openly and co-create action plans for improvement . Hold regular one-on-ones to understand individual concerns and aspirations, and to reinforce that their input is valued .</li> <li>Lead by Example in the Age of AI With the rise of generative AI, it\u2019s even more important to foster a culture of knowledge sharing and experimentation. Encourage your team to share both successes and failures with new tools, and remind them that everyone is learning together. This collective learning mindset is crucial for navigating rapid technological change .</li> </ol> <p>In summary, building psychological safety is an ongoing, intentional process. It requires you to model the behaviors you want to see, create structures that support open dialogue, and celebrate both the process and the outcomes of innovation. Over time, you\u2019ll see your team become more engaged, creative, and resilient. If you\u2019d like to dive deeper, we can explore how to measure psychological safety in your team, or discuss practical ways to run inclusive brainstorming sessions. Let me know which direction would be most helpful for your current challenges.</p> <p>tmpt-me</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.5701 0.5027 <p>Creating an environment where team members feel safe to share ideas is crucial for fostering innovation. Start by establishing psychological safety through open forums where team members can express their ideas and concerns without fear of judgment. Consider implementing an \"Ideas and Concerns\" forum where contributions can be made anonymously, and ensure these are addressed in team meetings to show that every voice is valued.</p> <p>Encourage a culture of collaboration by organizing regular ideation sessions or workshops. These sessions should be designed to allow team members to freely share and explore new ideas in a supportive setting. Additionally, promote a culture of learning from mistakes by emphasizing that errors are opportunities for growth rather than failures.</p> <p>It's also important to balance autonomy with support. Allow team members the freedom to explore solutions independently, but be available to guide them when necessary. This approach not only builds trust but also empowers team members to take thoughtful risks and innovate.

Drawing from my experience and the frameworks outlined in Leading Effective Engineering Teams as well as recent leadership discussions, here\u2019s a practical, research-backed approach you can take:</p> <ol> <li>Proactively Welcome and Onboard New Team Members Assign a buddy or mentor to each new joiner, introduce them to the team, and provide resources for a smooth onboarding. This helps new members feel valued and included from day one, reducing the anxiety of joining a new environment and accelerating their integration into the team\u2019s culture .</li> <li>Build Rapport and Foster Team Connections Encourage team-building activities\u2014whether it\u2019s virtual coffee chats, team lunches, or collaborative problem-solving sessions. These informal interactions help break down barriers, build trust, and create a sense of belonging, especially in remote or distributed teams .</li> <li>Celebrate Successes and Recognize Contributions Be an enthusiastic cheerleader for your team. Publicly acknowledge both team and individual achievements, and ensure credit is given where it\u2019s due. Recognition boosts morale and reinforces that everyone\u2019s work matters .</li> <li>Provide Constructive Feedback and Growth Opportunities Offer feedback that is both supportive and developmental. Focus on helping team members grow, not just pointing out mistakes. Empower people with autonomy and opportunities to take on new challenges, which signals trust and investment in their professional journey .</li> <li>Create Psychological Safety Foster an environment where everyone feels safe to speak up, share ideas, and admit mistakes without fear of embarrassment or retribution. Encourage open dialogue, actively listen to different perspectives, and address conflicts promptly and respectfully. Psychological safety is the single most important factor in team effectiveness, as highlighted by Google\u2019s Project Aristotle .</li> <li>Embrace and Celebrate Diversity Go beyond hiring for diversity\u2014actively cultivate an inclusive culture. Provide diversity and inclusion training, encourage open communication, and ensure equal opportunities for growth and development. Flexible work arrangements can help accommodate diverse needs and lifestyles, making everyone feel respected and supported .</li> <li>Address Unconscious Bias Conduct regular unconscious bias training and create safe spaces for team members to discuss their experiences. Open conversations about bias help surface and address issues before they impact team dynamics .</li> <li>Role-Model Civility and Empathy Lead by example: treat everyone with dignity, show genuine concern for their well-being, and be approachable. When leaders demonstrate respect and empathy, it sets the tone for the entire team .</li> <li>Connect Individual Work to Broader Impact Help each team member see how their work ties into the organization\u2019s goals and vision. When people understand the impact of their contributions, they feel more engaged and motivated .</li> <li>Regularly Check In and Solicit Feedback Have frequent one-on-ones to understand how team members are feeling, what challenges they\u2019re facing, and how you can support them. Actively listen and act on their feedback to continuously improve the team environment . Practical Example At Google, I\u2019ve seen the power of round-robin sessions where every team member, regardless of seniority, is given uninterrupted time to share their thoughts. This not only encourages quieter voices to speak up but also helps senior members practice active listening. Such practices, combined with a culture of open feedback and recognition, have consistently led to more cohesive and innovative teams .</li> </ol> <p>Would you like to dive deeper into specific strategies for addressing unconscious bias, or perhaps explore how to measure and improve psychological safety within your team?

How can I foster an environment where team members feel safe to express their ideas and concerns?","text":"<p>answers-v3</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.6809 0.9998 <p>Ensuring psychological safety in a large engineering team is foundational for innovation, engagement, and long-term success. Drawing from Addy Osmani\u2019s Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the live event Tech Leadership Tuesday with Lena Reinhard: Leading Effective Engineering Teams in the Age of Generative AI with Addy Osmani, here are actionable strategies and key insights to help you foster an environment where team members feel genuinely safe to express their ideas and concerns.</p> <p>Key Insights &amp; Practical Strategies 1. Model and Nurture Psychological Safety As Addy Osmani emphasizes in Leading Effective Engineering Teams:</p> <p>\u201cAs a team leader, you must nurture psychological safety so that team members feel safe speaking up, taking risks, and admitting mistakes. Creating psychological safety in a tech team setting involves proactive measures by the leader. Great leaders allow unconventional ideas and celebrate failures as learning opportunities. This environment fosters creative thinking without fear of embarrassment.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Publicly thank team members for raising concerns or sharing ideas, especially when they challenge the status quo. Facilitate open, nonjudgmental discussions and ask open-ended questions to encourage broader participation. Celebrate learning from failures, not just successes, to normalize risk-taking and experimentation. 2. Encourage Open Communication and Inclusive Dialogue \u201cAvoid monopolizing discussions and allow team members to speak. Foster an environment where all team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas, questions, and concerns. Encourage active participation, constructive contributions, and open dialogue, especially from remote team members.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Rotate meeting roles (facilitator, notetaker) to distribute responsibility and give everyone a voice. Use anonymous forums or regular \u201cIdeas and Concerns\u201d sessions to surface input from quieter or more introverted team members. Pair junior members with senior mentors to bridge experience gaps and foster trust. 3. Build an Inclusive and Supportive Team Culture \u201cA good manager understands that to create an inclusive team environment, one has to show concern for success and well-being. They create a safe space for team members to share their ideas and opinions, encourage them to think creatively and solve problems, show concern for the health of colleagues by offering support if they\u2019re having personal issues, encourage team members to learn from mistakes without judgment, and take time to get to know each team member personally.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Proactively welcome new team members and assign buddies for onboarding. Regularly check in on team members\u2019 well-being, not just their work output. Recognize and celebrate cultural and individual differences through team rituals or \u201ccultural exchange\u201d meetups. 4. Approach Conflict as a Collaborator, Not an Adversary \u201cApproach conflict as a collaborator, not an adversary. Look at conflicts optimistically as opportunities for growth and learning. Instead of taking sides or assigning blame, managers should facilitate open and respectful discussions where all parties involved can express their perspectives.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Frame disagreements as opportunities for collective problem-solving. Use language that is empathetic and inclusive\u2014\u201cspeak human to human.\u201d Anticipate reactions to sensitive topics and plan supportive responses. 5. Maintain High Standards Alongside Psychological Safety \u201cManagers who want to foster psychological safety in their teams must understand that doing so does not mean relaxing performance standards. You cannot allow inappropriate conduct just to ensure team members feel safe. Performance standards and psychological safety must both be high for people to speak up and voice concerns.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Set clear expectations for both behavior and results. Address issues constructively and fairly, ensuring accountability without blame. Reinforce that psychological safety is about enabling high performance, not avoiding difficult conversations. 6. Adapting to the Age of AI and Change In the context of generative AI and rapid technological change, Lena Reinhard and Addy Osmani highlight:</p> <p>\u201cLearn techniques for building psychological safety when introducing AI tools and managing team concerns about AI's impact on their roles... preserving human connection and creativity while integrating powerful new capabilities.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani &amp; Lena Reinhard, Tech Leadership Tuesday with Lena Reinhard: Leading Effective Engineering Teams in the Age of Generative AI with Addy Osmani </p> <p>How to apply this:</p> <p>Be transparent about how new tools (like AI) will impact workflows and roles. Invite feedback and concerns about technology adoption, and address them openly. Ensure that new tools enhance, rather than bypass, opportunities for learning and collaboration.

When one team member becomes the sole expert on a module, it can create a single point of failure. To mitigate this, encourage knowledge sharing and collaboration within your team. You can start by organizing internal tech talks where the expert shares insights about the module with others. Additionally, consider implementing cross-training programs where team members rotate roles or pair up to work on different parts of the project. This not only broadens the team's skill set but also reduces dependency on a single individual.

Let\u2019s walk through it with Addy Osmani\u2019s mindset:</p> <p>answers-v3</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.6028 0.9976 <p>Absolutely, this is a classic scenario that many engineering leaders encounter, and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re spotting it early. When a single team member becomes the \u201cgo-to\u201d expert for a module, it can create a single point of failure and lead to knowledge silos\u2014both of which can undermine your team\u2019s resilience and long-term effectiveness. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach this, drawing on the principles and real-world strategies I\u2019ve shared in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent leadership discussions :</p> <p>Why This Is a Problem When one person holds all the knowledge about a module, several risks emerge:</p> <p>Single Point of Failure: If that person is unavailable (vacation, illness, or leaves the company), progress can stall or critical issues may go unresolved. Knowledge Silos: Other team members miss out on learning opportunities, and the team\u2019s collective problem-solving ability is diminished. Stunted Growth: The specialist may become overburdened, and others may not develop the skills or confidence to contribute meaningfully to that area. Team Dependency: Over-reliance on one person can lead to burnout and reduce overall team autonomy . Practical Steps to Distribute Knowledge and Reduce Risk Here\u2019s a set of actionable strategies you can implement:</p> <ol> <li>Encourage Cross-Training and Pair Programming Pair the module expert with other engineers on tasks, code reviews, or bug fixes related to the module. Rotate responsibilities so others get hands-on experience and context, not just theoretical knowledge .</li> <li>Promote Documentation and Knowledge Sharing Ask the expert to document exceptional cases, FAQs, and the rationale behind key decisions in the module. Organize regular knowledge-sharing sessions or internal tech talks where the expert walks the team through the module\u2019s architecture, common pitfalls, and best practices .</li> <li>Foster a Culture of Collaboration Encourage open communication and a \u201cno-blame\u201d environment where team members feel safe to ask questions and admit what they don\u2019t know. Reward teamwork and knowledge sharing, not just individual heroics .</li> <li>Mentorship and Peer Learning Set up mentorship or buddy systems, pairing less experienced team members with the expert for onboarding or specific projects. Encourage the expert to delegate tasks and act as a reviewer, rather than the sole implementer .</li> <li>Monitor and Adjust During one-on-ones, check in with both the expert and other team members about their learning goals and comfort level with the module. Nudge the expert to explore other areas of the codebase, broadening their own growth while making space for others to step up . Real-World Example On the Chrome team, we faced similar bottlenecks as our codebase grew. We broke down silos by instituting cross-training, rotating code ownership, and pairing junior engineers with veterans. This not only distributed expertise but also scaled our team\u2019s capabilities without increasing headcount .</li> </ol> <p>The Goal Aim for a \u201chigh bus factor\u201d\u2014meaning, if any one person were to leave, the project would continue smoothly. Ideally, every expert should have at least one or two backups who are 60\u201380% as knowledgeable as they are about the module .</p> <p>Would you like to dive deeper into practical ways to run knowledge-sharing sessions, or perhaps explore how to motivate specialists to share their expertise?

This can involve organizing training sessions, pair programming, or shadowing opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rotation of responsibilities: Rotate the responsibilities for the specific module among team members to ensure that everyone has a chance to work on it and gain experience. This can help prevent burnout and promote a more collaborative team environment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Documentation: Encourage the team member to document their work, processes, and best practices related to the module. This can help ensure that knowledge is shared and accessible to other team members.</p> </li> <li> <p>Encourage collaboration: Foster a culture of collaboration within the team by encouraging open communication, sharing ideas, and working together on projects. This can help prevent silos of knowledge and promote a more cohesive team dynamic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Recognize and reward contributions: Acknowledge the contributions of the team member who is the go-to person for the module, but also recognize the efforts of other team members who contribute to the project. This can help motivate team members and prevent resentment or feelings of being undervalued.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By implementing these strategies, you can help prevent over-reliance on one team member for a specific module and promote a more balanced and collaborative team environment.</p> <p>openai-generated-prompt</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.5749 0.9582 <p>Hey there! It's great that you're thinking ahead about this. Having a single go-to person for a module can create bottlenecks and risks if that person becomes unavailable. Let's talk about how you can address this in a way that strengthens your team.</p> <p>1. Encourage Knowledge Sharing: Start by fostering a culture of knowledge sharing. Pair programming, code reviews, and lunch-and-learn sessions are excellent ways to spread expertise. Encourage your team member to mentor others on the module. This not only distributes knowledge but also builds trust and collaboration.</p> <p>2. Document Everything: Strong documentation is your friend here. Ensure that the module is well-documented, covering everything from architecture to common pitfalls. This will help others ramp up quickly and reduce dependency on a single person. Encourage your team to contribute to and maintain this documentation regularly.</p> <p>3. Rotate Responsibilities: Consider rotating responsibilities within the team. This can be done gradually, allowing others to take ownership of parts of the module. It helps build redundancy and gives team members a chance to grow their skills.</p> <p>4. Build Psychological Safety: Create an environment where team members feel safe to ask questions and make mistakes. This encourages learning and reduces the fear of stepping into unfamiliar territory. Psychological safety is key to effective collaboration and innovation.</p> <p>5. Set Clear Expectations: Communicate your expectations clearly. Let your team know that you value shared ownership and are committed to reducing single points of failure. This sets the tone for a more resilient team structure.</p> <p>6. Monitor and Adjust: Keep an eye on how these changes impact your team. Be open to feedback and ready to adjust your approach as needed. Continuous improvement is the goal.</p> <p>By taking these steps, you'll not only mitigate the risk of having a single point of failure but also empower your team to be more versatile and resilient.

Here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach this, drawing on the frameworks and practical advice from Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent leadership discussions:</p> <ol> <li>Recognize the \u201cGeneralist\u201d Antipattern When an engineer spreads themselves too thin across multiple domains, they risk becoming a \u201cgeneralist\u201d without true mastery in any area. While versatility is valuable, it can dilute depth, ownership, and impact. You\u2019ll often notice that such engineers are involved everywhere, but their contributions lack the depth needed for critical problem-solving or innovation. Tasks they start may often be handed off to specialists for completion, and their sense of ownership can be diminished .</li> </ol> <p>Action:</p> <p>Have a candid conversation with the engineer about the value of developing a T-shaped skill set: deep expertise in one area (the vertical bar of the T) while maintaining the ability to collaborate across domains (the horizontal bar) . 2. Guide Them to Focus on High-Impact Areas Encourage the engineer to identify where their unique strengths and interests align with the team\u2019s most critical needs. Ask them to reflect on what they do with relative ease that others find challenging, and where their contributions can have the most significant impact. Concentration\u2014doing one major thing at a time\u2014is the secret to effectiveness in engineering .</p> <p>Action:</p> <p>Work together to select one or two key areas for them to focus on, ideally where their strengths and the team\u2019s priorities intersect. Set clear, measurable goals for deepening expertise in these areas. 3. Structure Opportunities for Mastery Support their development by providing structured opportunities to build depth:</p> <p>Assign them ownership of a specific module or project area. Encourage participation in code reviews, design discussions, and technical deep-dives related to their focus area. Schedule regular check-ins to discuss progress, challenges, and learning goals . Action:</p> <p>Recommend they dedicate time each week to hands-on work, learning, and reflection in their chosen area. Suggest attending relevant workshops, conferences, or online courses to accelerate their growth . 4. Foster a Culture of Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration Encourage the engineer to share their learning journey with the team\u2014through documentation, tech talks, or mentoring others. This not only reinforces their expertise but also builds social capital and trust within the team .</p> <p>Action:</p> <p>Pair them with a mentor or senior engineer who can provide guidance and feedback.

It sounds like you're in a situation that many engineering managers face. Balancing breadth and depth in skill development is a common challenge. Let's dive into some strategies to help your engineer focus and develop expertise.</p> <p>1. Clarify Goals and Priorities: Start by having a one-on-one conversation with your engineer. Understand their interests and career goals. Are they trying to explore multiple areas because they're unsure of what they want to specialize in, or is it a case of FOMO (fear of missing out)? Once you have clarity, help them prioritize one or two areas that align with both their interests and the team's needs.</p> <p>2. Create a Learning Path: Once priorities are set, work together to create a learning path. This could include identifying key projects, resources, or mentors that can help them deepen their expertise. Encourage them to set specific, measurable goals for their learning journey.</p> <p>3. Encourage Deep Work: Help them carve out dedicated time for deep work on their chosen area. This might mean reducing context-switching by limiting their involvement in unrelated projects. Encourage practices like time-blocking to ensure they have uninterrupted periods to focus.</p> <p>4. Foster a Culture of Mastery: Encourage a culture where mastery is valued. Celebrate small wins and progress in their chosen area. This not only boosts motivation but also reinforces the importance of depth over breadth.</p> <p>5. Provide Feedback and Support: Regularly check in to provide feedback and support. Offer constructive insights on their progress and help them overcome any roadblocks. Remember, psychological safety is key\u2014ensure they feel comfortable discussing challenges without fear of judgment.</p> <p>6. Document and Share Knowledge: Encourage them to document their learnings and share insights with the team. This not only reinforces their understanding but also contributes to the team's collective knowledge.</p> <p>Protip: Encourage them to teach others what they learn. Teaching is a powerful way to solidify knowledge and identify any gaps in understanding.</p> <p>Ultimately, the goal is to help them find a balance between exploring new areas and developing deep expertise. By providing clarity, support, and a structured path, you'll empower them to grow in a way that's both fulfilling and impactful for the team. Keep fostering that high trust, low ego environment, and you'll see great results.</p> <p>cl-gradio-pe1</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.1751 0.9747 <p>Addressing this is all about striking the right balance. Sit down with the engineer and have a focused conversation about their strengths and interests. Help them identify one specific area of the project where they can develop mastery.

Drawing from my experience leading teams at Google and the insights I shared in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the Tech Leadership Tuesday session, here\u2019s a practical, research-backed approach you can implement.</p> <p>Why Knowledge Silos Happen\u2014and Why They Matter Knowledge silos typically form when expertise becomes concentrated in a few individuals\u2014often your \u201cspecialists\u201d or \u201crelentless guides.\u201d While deep expertise is valuable, it can create single points of failure, slow down onboarding, and stifle team growth. As I described in Leading Effective Engineering Teams:</p> <p>\u201cThe knowledge bottlenecks antipattern highlights a scenario where vital knowledge and expertise become concentrated within a limited number of individuals, resulting in a low bus factor... If these individuals were to leave the team or become unavailable, their absence could disrupt the project and hinder its progress.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>Practical Strategies to Prevent Silos and Distribute Expertise Here\u2019s a set of actionable steps, grounded in my own leadership journey and the frameworks I advocate:</p> <ol> <li>Cross-Training and Rotation Encourage team members to collaborate and cross-train across different domains. This broadens their understanding and skill set, making the team more adaptive and resilient. Rotate responsibilities periodically. This ensures that knowledge is spread and not owned by just a few individuals. For example, have engineers take turns owning different modules or features for a sprint or quarter .</li> <li>Structured Knowledge Sharing Regular knowledge-sharing sessions: Host internal tech talks, brown bags, or \u201clunch and learns\u201d where team members present on their areas of expertise or recent challenges they\u2019ve solved. Pair programming: Pair experienced engineers with less experienced ones to foster mutual learning and break down silos . Mentorship programs: Pair new or junior engineers with veterans to accelerate onboarding and institutionalize expertise .</li> <li>Documentation and Code Ownership Encourage specialists to document exceptional cases, FAQs, and architectural decisions. This makes critical knowledge accessible to everyone. Share code ownership: Avoid \u201ccode islands\u201d by ensuring multiple people are familiar with each major component. Use code reviews as a learning opportunity, not just a gatekeeping mechanism .</li> <li>Cultural Practices Promote a culture of open communication and psychological safety. As I noted in the book, teams that trust each other and feel safe asking questions are less likely to develop silos: \u201cOpen communication, shared knowledge, and a culture of collaboration can turn a team of individuals into a cohesive unit, producing outstanding results.\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </li> </ol> <p>Reward teamwork and collaboration: Recognize and celebrate when team members help each other or share knowledge, not just when they deliver individually . 5. Leadership Nudges Ask about learning goals in 1:1s: Regularly check in with your specialists about their aspirations and encourage them to expand their expertise into adjacent areas . Delegate and review: Have specialists delegate some of their changes to others, taking on a reviewer role to build up others\u2019 expertise . Lessons from the Field In my early days leading the Chrome team, we faced exactly these challenges. As the codebase grew, a few engineers became the go-to experts for certain components, creating bottlenecks. We broke these down by:</p> <p>Instituting cross-training and rotation programs Pairing junior engineers with veterans Encouraging more documentation and internal tech talks This approach \u201ccommoditized and institutionalized\u201d expertise, scaling our team\u2019s capabilities without increasing headcount .</p> <p>The Role of AI in Knowledge Sharing In the age of generative AI, there\u2019s a new layer to consider. As I discussed with Lena Reinhard:</p> <p>\u201cTeams will also need to start to think more about good knowledge-sharing protocols to address those risks of understanding how components or apps are built, staying in the AI\u2019s head. Because if you mostly just prompted your way to a solution and you sent it over as a pull request, you have to make sure that you\u2019re also thinking about the long term. Who\u2019s going to maintain the code? Do they understand how it works? Do we have documentation?\u201d \u2014 Addy Osmani, Tech Leadership Tuesday with Lena Reinhard: Leading Effective Engineering Teams in the Age of Generative AI </p> <p>So, as you integrate AI tools, double down on documentation, code reviews, and mentorship to ensure that wledge generated (or accelerated) by AI is truly shared and understood by the team.</p> <p>Closing Thoughts Preventing knowledge silos and distributing expertise is an ongoing leadership responsibility. It\u2019s about building a culture where learning, sharing, and collaboration are the norm\u2014not the exception. By implementing these strategies, you\u2019ll not only reduce risk but also unlock the full creative and problem-solving potential of your team.</p> <p>If you\u2019d like to dive deeper, you might want to explore how to measure the effectiveness of these interventions or adapt these practices for remote or distributed teams.

Drawing from Addy Osmani\u2019s Leading Effective Engineering Teams (O\u2019Reilly, 2024) and his recent conversation with Lena Reinhard in Tech Leadership Tuesday, here\u2019s a synthesis of actionable strategies, real-world insights, and best practices to help you foster stronger collaboration and communication within your engineering teams.</p> <p>Key Insights from Addy Osmani As Addy Osmani emphasizes in Leading Effective Engineering Teams:</p> <p>\u201cCommunication, both verbal and nonverbal, enables you to demonstrate other qualities like integrity, humility, and technical expertise. It is the most essential tool in your leadership toolbox that helps you motivate and influence others.\u201d \u2014Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>He also highlights the importance of trust and psychological safety:</p> <p>\u201cOpen communication, shared knowledge, and a culture of collaboration can turn a team of individuals into a cohesive unit, producing outstanding results. Trust can also help to foster better work-life balance for individuals on the team.\u201d \u2014Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>Strategies for Improving Team Communication 1. Prioritize Clear, Concise, and Inclusive Communication</p> <p>Use the \u201c7 C\u2019s\u201d framework: Ensure all communication is clear, concise, concrete, correct, coherent, complete, and courteous. This applies to meetings, emails, reports, and presentations . Tailor your communication style to your audience\u2014junior engineers, senior engineers, business stakeholders, etc.\u2014to ensure your message resonates and is understood . Practice active listening: Encourage team members to share their perspectives, and show genuine interest in their input. This builds trust and ensures everyone feels heard . 2. Leverage Both Verbal and Nonverbal Communication</p> <p>Be mindful of body language, facial expressions, and tone\u2014especially in remote or hybrid settings where nonverbal cues can be easily missed . Use video calls, emojis, and vocal tone to convey warmth and engagement in distributed teams . 3. Foster Psychological Safety and Trust</p> <p>Create an environment where team members feel safe to express ideas, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of negative consequences . Encourage open feedback and transparency about project goals, timelines, and challenges . Recognize and reward teamwork and collaboration, not just individual achievements . 4. Promote Cross-Functional and Cross-Team Collaboration</p> <p>Proactively seek opportunities to partner with other teams and departments to align on collective goals and outcomes . Role-model collaborative behavior by building relationships with stakeholders across the organization and encouraging open information sharing . Hold your team accountable for following company-wide practices and policies, ensuring alignment and reducing silos . 5. Embrace Diversity and Inclusion</p> <p>Recognize that diverse teams can be more innovative and effective, but only if you foster an inclusive and respectful environment . Organize team-building activities and informal gatherings to help team members understand and appreciate each other\u2019s backgrounds and perspectives . Assign tasks based on individual strengths and preferences, and encourage team members to diversify their skills over time . 6. Implement Agile and Iterative Practices</p> <p>Use agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) to provide structure for regular check-ins, feedback loops, and adaptability to change . Encourage experimentation, risk-taking, and continuous improvement\u2014reward teams for being responsive to changing circumstances . 7. Minimize Friction and Address Issues Proactively</p> <p>Regularly audit processes to identify and resolve bottlenecks or inefficiencies . Address conflicts or misunderstandings swiftly to prevent escalation and maintain positive momentum . Ensure role clarity so everyone understands their responsibilities and how they fit into the bigger picture . Practical Example Addy Osmani shares a candid story from his time at Google:</p> <p>\u201cDespite thinking we had a clear, concise message and working hard to get sign-offs from everyone ahead of the \u2018moment,\u2019 we completely neglected to inform our Developer Relations (DevRel) team about the launch. Because it came as a surprise, they had to scramble at the last minute to provide input, which we felt awful about. The launch went well in the end, but we learned to take an oversharing/inclusive approach to internal launch preparations in the future to avoid this.\u201d \u2014Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>This underscores the value of over-communicating and ensuring all relevant stakeholders are included early in the process.</p> <p>Additional Considerations in the Age of AI In the Tech Leadership Tuesday session, Osmani and Reinhard discuss how generative AI is reshaping team dynamics:</p> <p>Leaders should ensure that AI tools enhance\u2014not bypass\u2014collaboration and learning, especially for junior team members. Maintain code quality standards and reimagine mentorship in an AI-augmented environment.

This is a common and important question, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re asking it early in your journey. Let\u2019s break down the distinction between leadership and management, and then explore how you can balance both for your team\u2019s success.</p> <p>Leadership vs. Management: What\u2019s the Difference? Management is fundamentally about planning, organizing, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. It\u2019s the operational side of your role\u2014setting timelines, allocating resources, ensuring processes run smoothly, and solving day-to-day problems. Think of management as the engine that keeps the train running on time and on the right track.</p> <p>Leadership, on the other hand, is about setting direction, inspiring, and motivating people. It\u2019s less about the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow,\u201d and more about the \u201cwhy.\u201d Leaders create a vision, align people around that vision, and empower them to achieve more than they thought possible. Leadership is about change, movement, and growth\u2014helping your team adapt, innovate, and reach new heights.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a quick comparison to clarify the distinction:</p> <p>Leadership  Management Establishes direction and vision    Plans and budgets Aligns and inspires people  Organizes and staffs Motivates and empowers  Controls and problem-solves Drives change and innovation    Maintains order and consistency</p> <p>Both are essential. Leadership without management can lead to chaos; management without leadership can lead to stagnation. The most effective engineering leaders blend both skill sets seamlessly .</p> <p>Balancing Leadership and Management in Your Team 1. Shift from \u201cMe\u201d to \u201cWe\u201d As you transition from an individual contributor to a leader, your impact is no longer measured by your own output, but by the collective success of your team. Focus on enabling others, sharing knowledge, and lifting those around you. This mindset shift is foundational .</p> <ol> <li> <p>Prioritize People Over Technical Tasks It\u2019s tempting to stay hands-on with code, but your primary responsibility is now to support, mentor, and develop your team. Invest time in one-on-ones, team meetings, and cross-team collaboration. Let go of the urge to micromanage technical details\u2014empower your team to own solutions .</p> </li> <li> <p>Communicate Vision and Set Clear Expectations As a leader, articulate a compelling vision and ensure everyone understands how their work contributes to it. As a manager, translate that vision into actionable plans, clear goals, and well-defined roles. Regularly check in to keep everyone aligned .</p> </li> <li> <p>Foster Psychological Safety and Trust Especially in times of change (like integrating AI tools), create an environment where team members feel safe to ask questions, share concerns, and experiment. This is a core leadership responsibility that also supports effective management .</p> </li> <li> <p>Adapt and Evolve The landscape is always shifting\u2014whether it\u2019s new technology, changing business needs, or team dynamics. Be ready to adapt your approach, combining the stability of management with the flexibility and inspiration of leadership .</p> </li> </ol> <p>Practical Tips for Day-to-Day Balance Delegate technical tasks to your team, but stay close enough to understand challenges and provide guidance. Schedule regular one-on-ones to mentor and coach, not just to check on progress. Use structured meetings for planning and problem-solving, but also carve out time for vision-setting and team-building. Solicit feedback from your team and peers\u2014leadership is a continuous learning process. Celebrate wins and learn from failures together, reinforcing both accountability (management) and growth (leadership). Balancing leadership and management is a journey, not a destination. The best leaders I\u2019ve seen are those who regularly reflect, seek feedback, and are willing to adapt. If you\u2019re interested in diving deeper, you might want to explore how to build psychological safety or navigate the transition from engineer to manager in your own context.</p> <p>Let me know if you\u2019d like to discuss specific scenarios or challenges you\u2019re facing\u2014I\u2019m here to help you grow into a confident, effective leader.</p>"},{"location":"question-18/#leadership-vs-management","title":"Leadership vs. Management","text":"<ol> <li>Leadership:</li> <li>Vision and Inspiration: Leaders create a vision for the future and inspire their teams to work towards that vision.

This means not just sharing the \u201cwhat\u201d but also the \u201cwhy\u201d\u2014helping each team member see how their work ladders up to the broader mission. Use frameworks like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to create a direct line of sight between individual tasks and organizational objectives. When people understand the impact of their work, motivation naturally increases .</li> </ol> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Set quarterly OKRs that connect to at least one higher-level company objective. Regularly review progress and celebrate milestones to reinforce the connection between effort and impact . 2. Foster a Shared Mindset and Psychological Safety A high-performing team thrives on psychological safety and a shared sense of purpose. Encourage open communication, where team members feel safe to share ideas, voice concerns, and even challenge decisions. This not only surfaces better solutions but also builds trust and engagement .</p> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Hold regular brainstorming sessions and check-ins. Share user personas, mock-ups, or customer feedback to make the \u201cwhy\u201d behind priorities tangible. Model vulnerability and openness as a leader, especially when introducing new tools or changes (such as GenAI) . 3. Involve the Team in Shaping the Path Motivation soars when people feel ownership. Involve your team in shaping how you\u2019ll achieve organizational goals. Solicit their input on priorities, process improvements, and even the adoption of new technologies like generative AI. This collaborative approach not only surfaces valuable insights but also increases buy-in .</p> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Co-create the team\u2019s vision and strategy where possible. Encourage team members to propose and lead initiatives aligned with company goals. 4. Communicate Relentlessly and Transparently Consistent, transparent communication is the glue that keeps alignment and motivation strong. Regularly update your team on how their work is moving the needle, what\u2019s changing at the organizational level, and why certain priorities are shifting. This helps reduce uncertainty and keeps everyone focused .</p> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Share context for tasks, not just assignments. Discuss both achievements and challenges openly. Explain the rationale behind changes in direction or strategy. 5. Empower and Unblock Empower your team by removing obstacles and giving them autonomy within clear boundaries. Make sure they have the resources, support, and clarity needed to execute. When people feel trusted and supported, they\u2019re more likely to stay motivated\u2014even when priorities shift .</p> <p>Practical steps:</p> <p>Actively identify and remove roadblocks. Delegate ownership of key areas, making roles and responsibilities explicit. 6. Balance AI Adoption with Human Growth In the age of generative AI, it\u2019s crucial to ensure that new tools enhance\u2014not bypass\u2014learning and collaboration.

Drawing from the principles in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the recent Tech Leadership Tuesday session, let\u2019s break down actionable strategies to help you foster an inclusive, high-performing environment that truly leverages your team\u2019s diversity.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Acknowledge and Address Coordination Challenges in Diverse Teams Diversity brings a wealth of perspectives, but it can also introduce friction\u2014differences in communication styles, work habits, and even expectations around flexibility (e.g., team members with young children may need different work hours). The key is to recognize that diversity alone isn\u2019t enough; you must intentionally build an environment where everyone feels included and respected. For example, I\u2019ve seen teams where junior members hesitate to speak up, feeling overshadowed by more experienced colleagues. To counter this, I recommend structured opportunities for everyone to contribute, such as round-robin discussions or dedicated time for each voice in meetings. This not only surfaces more ideas but also builds confidence and trust across the team .</p> </li> <li> <p>Build Psychological Safety and Trust Psychological safety is the foundation of effective, inclusive teams. When team members feel safe to express ideas, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of embarrassment or retribution, you unlock their full potential. Research (including Google\u2019s Project Aristotle) shows that teams with high psychological safety are more innovative, retain talent better, and outperform their peers. As a leader, model vulnerability, thank people for raising issues, and facilitate open, judgment-free discussions. Encourage feedback and make it clear that every perspective is valued, regardless of seniority or background .</p> </li> <li> <p>Foster Inclusive Practices and Clear Communication Onboarding and Integration: Proactively welcome new team members, assign buddies or mentors, and ensure they have the resources to succeed. This helps everyone feel part of the team from day one. Role Clarity: Make sure everyone understands their responsibilities and how their work fits into the bigger picture. This reduces confusion and duplication of effort, especially important in diverse teams where assumptions may differ. Open Communication Channels: Encourage frequent, transparent communication. Use regular check-ins, open forums, and asynchronous tools to ensure everyone can participate, regardless of location or time zone .</p> </li> <li>Leverage Diversity Through Structured Collaboration Interdisciplinary Sessions: Organize regular cross-domain meetings to encourage knowledge sharing and break down silos. Rotating Roles: Allow team members to temporarily join different subteams or projects, broadening their perspectives and building empathy. Cross-Domain Initiatives: Launch projects that require collaboration between different specialties, ensuring diverse viewpoints are integrated into solutions .</li> <li>Address Unconscious Bias and Promote Inclusion Bias Training: Regularly conduct unconscious bias training and create safe spaces for open discussion about experiences and challenges. Diverse Hiring and Retention: Expand recruitment efforts to reach underrepresented groups and partner with organizations that support diversity in tech. Inclusive Culture: Celebrate differences, encourage learning from mistakes, and show genuine concern for each team member\u2019s well-being. Recognize and reward inclusive behaviors as much as technical achievements .</li> <li> <p>Empower Autonomy and Growth Give your team members autonomy to shape their work and encourage them to take ownership of their growth. Provide constructive feedback, advocate for their achievements, and support their professional development. This not only boosts morale but also helps retain diverse talent .</p> </li> <li> <p>Practical Example: Structured Meetings for Inclusion In one of my teams, we had members from four continents and a wide range of experience levels. Early meetings were dominated by a few voices. By introducing round-robin sharing and explicitly inviting input from quieter members, we saw a marked increase in engagement and the quality of ideas. Over time, this built a culture where everyone felt their contributions mattered, regardless of background or tenure .</p> </li> </ol> <p>Summary Table: Key Actions Action Area Practical Steps Psychological Safety    Model vulnerability, thank issue-raisers, facilitate open discussion Inclusive Onboarding    Assign buddies, provide resources, welcome new members Role Clarity    Define responsibilities, clarify expectations Open Communication  Use regular check-ins, open forums, async tools Cross-Team Collaboration    Interdisciplinary sessions, rotating roles, cross-domain projects Bias &amp; Inclusion    Bias training, diverse hiring, celebrate differences Empowerment &amp; Growth    Give autonomy, provide feedback, advocate for achievements</p> <p>Would you like to dive deeper into practical meeting structures for inclusion, explore ways to measure psychological safety, or discuss strategies for addressing unconscious bias within your team?

How can I ensure that we're being effective and not just efficient?","text":"<p>answers-v3</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.4647 1.0 <p>This is a fantastic and very timely question\u2014one that every engineering leader faces, especially in fast-moving environments. Delivering a lot of code can feel productive, but as you\u2019ve sensed, output alone doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019re solving the right problems or driving meaningful impact. Let\u2019s break down how you can ensure your team is truly effective, not just efficient, drawing on the frameworks and practical advice from Leading Effective Engineering Teams and the recent Tech Leadership Tuesday session.</p> <p>Understanding Effectiveness vs. Efficiency First, it\u2019s crucial to distinguish between efficiency and effectiveness:</p> <p>Efficiency is about doing things right\u2014minimizing waste, maximizing output, and streamlining processes. For example, your team might be shipping features quickly and with clean code. Effectiveness is about doing the right things\u2014delivering outcomes that matter to your users and your business. It\u2019s not just about how much you deliver, but whether what you deliver actually solves real problems and creates value. Productivity is output over input, but it\u2019s only meaningful if the output is valuable . If your team is highly efficient but not effective, you risk building features that don\u2019t move the needle for your users or your company.</p> <p>Shifting Focus: From Output to Outcomes To ensure your team is effective:</p> <p>Align with Business and User Goals: Regularly revisit your team\u2019s objectives and ensure they map directly to business outcomes or user needs. Ask: \u201cHow does this feature or project help our users or advance our company\u2019s strategy?\u201d  Prioritize Ruthlessly: Use frameworks like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to set clear, outcome-oriented goals. This helps the team focus on what matters most, not just what\u2019s easy or interesting to build . Measure What Matters: Track metrics that reflect real impact\u2014user adoption, customer satisfaction, business KPIs\u2014not just velocity or number of pull requests . Seek Feedback Early and Often: Engage stakeholders and users throughout the development process. Their feedback is a reality check on whether you\u2019re solving the right problems . Building a Culture of Effectiveness Foster Psychological Safety: Encourage your team to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and share concerns if they feel work isn\u2019t aligned with the right goals. This openness is foundational for course-correcting early . Clarify Roles and Responsibilities: Make sure everyone knows not just what to do, but why it matters. This clarity helps avoid wasted effort and keeps the team focused . Balance Efficiency with Innovation: Streamline processes where possible, but don\u2019t over-optimize to the point that you stifle creativity or adaptability. Leave room for experimentation and learning . Practical Steps for New Leaders Here\u2019s a simple checklist to get started:</p> <p>Step    Action  Why It Matters 1   Review your team\u2019s current goals and backlog    Ensure alignment with business/user outcomes  2   Set or revisit OKRs with your team  Focus on outcomes, not just outputs  3   Implement regular stakeholder check-ins Validate you\u2019re solving the right problems  4   Track both delivery metrics and impact metrics  Balance efficiency and effectiveness  5   Encourage open discussion about priorities  Build psychological safety and adaptability </p> <p>Navigating the Age of AI If your team is leveraging AI tools, be especially mindful:</p> <p>Don\u2019t Over-Rely on AI for Output: Always verify AI-generated code and ensure it aligns with your standards and goals. Human review is essential . Maintain Critical Thinking: Encourage engineers (especially juniors) to understand and explain what AI-generated code is doing, so you don\u2019t lose sight of the \u201cwhy\u201d behind your work . Focus on Real Value: Avoid shipping features just because AI makes it easy\u2014ensure every release is genuinely useful to your users . Final Thought As a new leader, your most important job is to keep your team focused on delivering value, not just volume. By setting clear, outcome-driven goals, fostering a culture of open communication, and regularly validating your direction with stakeholders, you\u2019ll ensure your team is not just busy, but truly effective.</p> <p>If you\u2019d like to dive deeper, you might want to explore how to measure engineering effectiveness in practice or discuss strategies for focusing on the right things in engineering teams.

It's great that you're thinking about effectiveness versus just efficiency. Delivering a lot of code is one thing, but ensuring that code aligns with your team's goals and the broader business objectives is where the real impact lies. Let's dive into some strategies to help you focus on the right things.</p> <p>1. Define Clear Objectives: Start by ensuring that your team has a clear understanding of the goals you're trying to achieve. Are you solving the right problems? Regularly revisit your team's objectives and make sure they align with the company's vision. This clarity helps prioritize work that truly matters.</p> <p>2. Measure Impact, Not Just Output: It's easy to get caught up in metrics like lines of code or number of commits. Instead, focus on the impact of the work. Are the features you're shipping improving user experience or solving customer pain points? Use metrics that reflect the value delivered, like user engagement or performance improvements.</p> <p>3. Foster Open Communication: Encourage your team to voice concerns or suggest improvements. Sometimes the best insights come from those closest to the work. Create a culture where it's safe to question priorities and propose changes.</p> <p>4. Regularly Review and Reflect: Implement regular retrospectives to assess what's working and what isn't. This isn't just about process improvements but also about ensuring you're on the right path. Ask questions like, \"Are we solving the right problems?\" and \"What can we do better?\"</p> <p>5. Balance Autonomy with Alignment: Give your team the autonomy to make decisions, but ensure there's alignment with the broader goals. This balance reduces coordination overhead and empowers your team to focus on impactful work.</p> <p>6. Encourage Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: Good documentation helps maintain focus and clarity. It ensures everyone is on the same page and can reduce misunderstandings about priorities and objectives.</p> <p>7. Build Psychological Safety: When your team feels safe to take risks and make mistakes, they're more likely to innovate and focus on meaningful work. Encourage a culture of trust and low ego collaboration.</p> <p>Protip: Regularly ask your team, \"What are we doing today that we shouldn't be doing?\" This simple question can uncover inefficiencies and misalignments that might be hindering your effectiveness.</p> <p>Remember, being effective is about doing the right things, not just doing things right. Keep iterating on these practices, and you'll find your team not only delivering code but delivering value.

Let\u2019s break down how you can measure and improve both efficiency and effectiveness, while ensuring quality remains a non-negotiable part of your team\u2019s DNA.</p> <p>Measuring Efficiency vs. Effectiveness First, it\u2019s important to distinguish between these terms:</p> <p>Efficiency is about doing things right\u2014minimizing waste, maximizing output, and optimizing resource use. Typical measures include:</p> <p>Features delivered per unit of time Bug fix rate and defect density Resource utilization (time, money, personnel) Time to complete tasks or releases Effectiveness is about doing the right things\u2014delivering outcomes that matter to your users and business. Measures here include:</p> <p>Customer satisfaction (NPS, CSAT) Business value delivered (impact on KPIs) User adoption rates Return on investment (ROI) Time to market for meaningful features Productivity is a subset of efficiency, but focusing solely on output (like lines of code or story points) can be misleading. Instead, combine these metrics with outcome-based measures to get a holistic view of your team\u2019s performance. For example, tracking deployment frequency alongside customer satisfaction gives you a sense of both speed and value delivered[0][14].</p> <p>Improving Both\u2014Without Sacrificing Quality Here\u2019s how you can drive both efficiency and effectiveness, while keeping quality front and center:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Prioritize Outcomes Over Outputs Encourage your team to focus on the impact of their work, not just the volume. Make sure everyone understands how their work ties to business goals and user needs. This mindset shift helps avoid the trap of shipping features quickly that don\u2019t actually move the needle for your users or business[0][14].</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the Right Metrics Adopt a balanced scorecard approach:</p> </li> </ol> <p>For efficiency: Track cycle time, deployment frequency, bug fix rate, and resource utilization. For effectiveness: Monitor user adoption, customer feedback, and business impact metrics. For quality: Keep an eye on defect density, code review outcomes, and post-release incident rates. Regularly review these metrics together, not in isolation, to spot trade-offs or imbalances early[0][14].</p> <ol> <li> <p>Foster a Culture of Collaboration and Psychological Safety Teams that feel safe to share ideas, challenge assumptions, and learn from mistakes are more likely to innovate and maintain high standards. Psychological safety is foundational for both speed and quality\u2014people need to feel comfortable raising concerns about shortcuts or technical debt[13][14].</p> </li> <li> <p>Invest in Code Health and Technical Excellence High code quality is a force multiplier for both efficiency and effectiveness. Encourage practices like:</p> </li> </ol> <p>Regular code reviews Automated testing and CI/CD Refactoring and managing technical debt Using modern, reliable tools These reduce friction, prevent regressions, and make it easier to move quickly without breaking things[*14].</p> <ol> <li> <p>Empower and Upskill Your Team Empower team members to make decisions and take ownership. Invest in mentorship, skill development, and knowledge sharing. This not only boosts efficiency (by reducing bottlenecks) but also ensures that quality and effectiveness are sustained as your team scales[6][14].</p> </li> <li> <p>Continuously Improve Adopt a growth mindset\u2014regularly reflect on what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t.

Prioritize Focus and Flow: Protect your team's focus time. This might mean setting aside dedicated blocks of time for deep work or minimizing unnecessary meetings. Tools like \"focus Fridays\" or \"no-meeting mornings\" can be effective. When engineers have uninterrupted time, both productivity and quality tend to improve.</p> <p>4. Encourage Strong Documentation: Good documentation can be a game-changer. It reduces onboarding time, minimizes misunderstandings, and serves as a reference that can improve both speed and accuracy. Encourage your team to document not just the \"what\" but also the \"why\" behind decisions.</p> <p>5. Build Psychological Safety: Teams that feel safe to take risks and speak up without fear of judgment are more innovative and effective. Encourage open communication and make it clear that mistakes are learning opportunities. This will lead to better problem-solving and higher-quality outcomes.</p> <p>6. Balance Autonomy with Alignment: Give your team the autonomy to make decisions, but ensure they\u2019re aligned with the broader goals. This can be achieved through clear objectives and key results (OKRs) or similar frameworks. When everyone understands the \"why,\" they can make better decisions about the \"how.\"</p> <p>7. Regularly Review and Adjust: Finally, regularly review your metrics and processes. Are they still serving your team well? Are there new challenges that need addressing? Be willing to adjust your approach based on feedback and changing circumstances.</p> <p>Remember, the goal is not to maximize one at the expense of the other but to find a sustainable balance that works for your team. By focusing on clarity, communication, and continuous improvement, you can create an environment where both productivity and quality thrive.

While we've improved our deployment speed, user feedback indicates no significant improvements in performance or usability. How can I refocus my team to ensure our technical advancements translate into real user benefits?","text":"<p>answers-v3</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.365 0.4901 <p>Absolutely, this is a scenario I\u2019ve seen play out in many high-performing teams\u2014yours is not alone. Let\u2019s break down how you can realign your team\u2019s focus so that your technical investments in microservices and Kubernetes deliver tangible value to your users.</p> <ol> <li>Recognize the Difference Between Output and Outcome</li> </ol> <p>It\u2019s common for engineering teams to celebrate technical milestones\u2014like faster deployments or a successful migration to new infrastructure. However, these are outputs, not outcomes. True effectiveness is measured by the impact on your users and the business, not just by technical achievements. In other words, efficiency (doing things right) and productivity (doing more) are important, but effectiveness (doing the right things) is what ultimately matters for your users and your organization .</p> <ol> <li>Diagnose the Disconnect</li> </ol> <p>Your team\u2019s excitement about the migration is understandable, but if users aren\u2019t experiencing better performance or usability, it\u2019s a sign that the technical work hasn\u2019t yet translated into user value. This often happens when teams focus on the \u201chow\u201d (the technology) and lose sight of the \u201cwhy\u201d (the user benefit). It\u2019s essential to step back and ask: What specific user problems were we hoping to solve with this migration? Are those problems now being addressed? </p> <ol> <li>Shift the Conversation to User Outcomes</li> </ol> <p>Refocus your team by making user outcomes the central metric of success. Here\u2019s how you can do that:</p> <p>Define Success in User Terms: Work with your product and UX partners to articulate what success looks like for your users. Is it faster load times? Fewer errors? A more intuitive workflow? Make these outcomes explicit and measurable . Measure What Matters: Move beyond technical metrics (like deployment frequency) and track user-centric metrics\u2014such as user satisfaction, adoption rates, and task completion times. These will tell you if your technical changes are making a real difference . Close the Feedback Loop: Regularly review user feedback and usage data with your team. Celebrate wins where technical changes have improved user experience, and treat gaps as opportunities for further iteration . 4. Leverage Your New Capabilities for User Value</p> <p>Now that you have a more flexible and scalable architecture, ask: How can we use this to deliver features or improvements that users will notice and appreciate? For example:</p> <p>Can you roll out performance enhancements that were previously too risky or complex? Are there new user-facing features that are now feasible because of your new architecture? Can you improve reliability or uptime in ways that directly benefit users?  5. Foster a Culture of User-Centric Engineering</p> <p>Encourage your team to think beyond the code. This means:</p> <p>Involving engineers in user research and usability testing so they see firsthand how users interact with the product. Encouraging open communication with stakeholders from product, design, and support to stay aligned on user needs . Making it a habit to ask, \u201cHow will this help our users?\u201d before starting any new technical initiative . 6. Tell the Story of Impact</p> <p>When you do deliver user-facing improvements, communicate them clearly\u2014both internally and externally. This helps reinforce the connection between technical work and user value, motivating your team and building trust with stakeholders .</p> <p>In summary, the key is to move from celebrating technical progress for its own sake to celebrating the user impact that your technical progress enables. By defining effectiveness in terms of user outcomes, measuring what matters, and fostering a culture that keeps the user at the center, you\u2019ll ensure your investments in microservices and Kubernetes pay off in ways your users will truly notice .</p> <p>If you\u2019d like to dive deeper, we could explore how to set up user-centric metrics for your team or discuss practical ways to involve engineers in user research.

First, revisit user feedback with your team to identify areas where performance or usability can be truly enhanced. Foster a mindset that values outcomes over outputs. Engage your engineers in user empathy exercises like shadowing support or participating in usability tests\u2014this builds a connection between their work and user needs. Next, empower them to propose solutions that address both the technical and experiential aspects, perhaps through workshops focused on user journey mapping. Finally, set clear OKRs that align technical improvements with user impact, and make performance metrics a regular part of your discussions to ensure everyone sees the real-world effects. Keep communication channels open, and remember\u2014technology should serve users, not the other way around.</p> <p>basic-gpt4o</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.4106 0.001 <p>It's great to hear that your team has successfully transitioned to using microservices and Kubernetes, as these technologies can indeed enhance deployment speed and scalability. However, as you've noticed, technical advancements don't always directly translate into improved user experiences. Here are some strategies to refocus your team and ensure that your technical efforts lead to tangible user benefits:</p> <ol> <li> <p>User-Centric Metrics: Start by identifying and tracking metrics that directly impact user experience, such as page load times, responsiveness, and error rates. Tools like Google Lighthouse can help you measure these aspects. Ensure that your team understands the importance of these metrics and how they relate to user satisfaction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Performance Budgets: Establish performance budgets that set limits on acceptable load times and resource usage.

Let\u2019s break down a practical, evidence-based approach that you can use to set your team up for success, drawing directly from the frameworks and lessons I\u2019ve shared in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent leadership discussions.</p> <ol> <li>Start with Organizational Alignment Effectiveness isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all concept\u2014it\u2019s about \u201cdoing the right things\u201d that deliver value to your organization and its customers. The first step is to understand what success looks like for your business domain. This means:</li> </ol> <p>Reviewing your organization\u2019s mission, vision, and strategic objectives. Identifying how your team\u2019s work contributes to those broader goals. Avoiding blanket definitions\u2014tailor effectiveness to your team\u2019s context and the outcomes your organization values most . For example, if your company\u2019s top priority is customer satisfaction, your team\u2019s effectiveness might be measured by timely delivery of high-quality software that directly impacts customer experience .</p> <ol> <li>Define Team-Specific Goals and Metrics Once you have clarity on organizational objectives, cascade them down to your team:</li> </ol> <p>Set clear, specific goals for your team that are in service of the organization\u2019s priorities. Use frameworks like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) or SMART goals to ensure your objectives are actionable and measurable. Identify relevant metrics\u2014these could be user adoption rates, system reliability, delivery timelines, or customer satisfaction scores, depending on your context . It\u2019s important that not every organizational OKR needs to be reflected in every team OKR, but there should be a clear connection between the two .</p> <ol> <li>Communicate and Co-Create the Definition Effectiveness should be a shared understanding, not just a top-down directive. Here\u2019s how to make it real for your team:</li> </ol> <p>Communicate your definition of effectiveness clearly and repeatedly, using multiple channels (team meetings, documentation, one-on-ones). Involve your team in refining what effectiveness means for them\u2014this builds buy-in and surfaces valuable perspectives. Provide training and context so everyone understands not just the \u201cwhat,\u201d but the \u201cwhy\u201d behind your effectiveness criteria . 4. Enable, Empower, and Expand I use the \u201c3 E\u2019s Model\u201d as a practical guide:</p> <p>Enable: Define and share what effectiveness means. Provide the knowledge, support, and tools your team needs to achieve it. Empower: Remove blockers, facilitate autonomy, and give your team the authority to make decisions that drive toward those goals. Expand: Once you have a working model, scale it\u2014apply your success patterns to other teams or broader organizational challenges . 5. Measure, Feedback, and Iterate Track progress against your defined metrics and goals. Provide timely, constructive feedback\u2014celebrate wins and address gaps. Regularly revisit and refine your definition of effectiveness as your team and organization evolve . Practical Example Suppose you\u2019re leading a platform team in a SaaS company. The organization\u2019s goal is to improve customer retention. Your team\u2019s effectiveness might be defined as:</p> <p>Reducing platform downtime by 50% over the next quarter (measured by incident reports and uptime metrics). Delivering two new features that directly address top customer pain points (measured by customer feedback and adoption rates). Improving internal developer satisfaction with platform tools (measured by internal surveys). Each of these is specific, measurable, and clearly tied to the organization\u2019s broader goal of retention.</p> <p>Key Takeaways Effectiveness = \u201cDoing the right things\u201d that deliver value to your organization and customers . Align team goals with organizational objectives using frameworks like OKRs or SMART goals . Make the definition collaborative, clear, and actionable . Use the 3 E\u2019s Model: Enable, Empower, Expand . Measure, provide feedback, and iterate .

First, establish clear guardrails\u2014these are guidelines and boundaries that help your team understand their roles and responsibilities while giving them the freedom to make decisions within those parameters. This includes setting clear communication channels, defining roles, and having regular check-ins to ensure alignment with project goals.</p> <p>Next, encourage a culture of trust and empowerment. Trust your team members to make the right decisions and provide them with the autonomy to explore creative solutions. This trust can significantly boost their motivation and commitment to delivering high-quality work.</p> <p>Additionally, focus on providing mentorship and opportunities for skill development. By investing in your team's growth, you not only enhance their capabilities but also show that you value their contributions, which can lead to increased ownership and accountability.</p> <p>Finally, promote a sense of ownership by allowing teams to take charge of specific features or projects. Let them decide on the technical approach, timelines, and execution strategies. This not only fosters responsibility but also encourages innovation and creativity.</p> <p>answers-v3</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.6608 0.9979 <p>Empowering engineering teams to take true ownership\u2014fostering both autonomy and accountability\u2014is a central theme in Addy Osmani\u2019s Leading Effective Engineering Teams and is further explored in his recent conversation with Lena Reinhard. Drawing from these resources, here are actionable strategies, key insights, and practical examples to help you address your current challenges.</p> <ol> <li>Build a Foundation of Trust and Psychological Safety A recurring insight from Addy Osmani is that autonomy and accountability are built on trust. Teams need to feel safe to take risks, voice ideas, and learn from failures. As Osmani puts it:</li> </ol> <p>\"In a psychologically safe environment, team members feel empowered to take risks, voice their ideas and opinions openly, and view failures as valuable opportunities for growth and learning. As a leader, it is your responsibility to actively foster and maintain this type of culture, where experimentation, innovation, and continuous improvement are not only encouraged but celebrated as essential components of success.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Encourage open dialogue and regular feedback. Publicly thank team members for raising issues or surfacing problems early. Frame failures as learning opportunities, not as blameworthy events . 2. Clarify Roles, Responsibilities, and Expectations Ownership thrives when everyone knows what they are responsible for and how their work fits into the bigger picture. Osmani highlights the importance of role clarity:</p> <p>\"Role clarity can thus help to cultivate a sense of team spirit and unity if you align responsibilities with individual strengths and skills. You must also highlight the interdependence of team members\u2019 contributions, emphasizing the collaborative aspect of their work.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Define and communicate clear roles and responsibilities. Regularly review and adapt these roles as the team and projects evolve. Emphasize how each person\u2019s work contributes to team and organizational goals . 3. Delegate Authority and Avoid Micromanagement Empowerment means giving your team the authority and independence to make decisions. Osmani warns against micromanagement, which stifles both autonomy and innovation:</p> <p>\"Certain managers tell their teams exactly how to execute tasks rather than highlighting what needs to be done. This approach stifles the team\u2019s autonomy and creativity and hampers their ability to find innovative solutions.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Focus on outcomes, not prescribing every step. Delegate meaningful responsibilities and let team members lead initiatives or meetings. Provide support and resources, but step back to let the team own the process . 4. Foster Accountability Through Clear Goals and Feedback Accountability is not about blame, but about clarity and follow-through. Osmani recommends:</p> <p>\"Hold leaders accountable for driving improvements and making decisions contributing to the team\u2019s growth and success... Fostering a proactive and engaged leadership style that provides clear direction, gives actionable feedback, and embraces change is essential for creating a dynamic and thriving team environment.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Set clear, measurable goals and regularly review progress. Provide constructive, actionable feedback. Celebrate ownership and initiative, and address issues directly but supportively . 5. Encourage Autonomy with Support and Growth Opportunities Autonomy is most effective when paired with support and opportunities for growth. Osmani\u2019s \u201cfeed opportunities, starve problems\u201d principle is especially relevant:</p> <p>\"Empowering grants individuals or teams the authority, independence, and trust to take ownership of their work and make decisions. It emphasizes giving individuals the power, confidence, and freedom to act independently and be accountable for their actions and outcomes.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Assign projects that align with team members\u2019 strengths and interests. Offer training, mentorship, and cross-functional collaboration opportunities. Encourage experimentation and risk-taking, rewarding learning and adaptability . 6. Leverage Team Rituals and Agile Practices Agile methodologies and regular team rituals (like retrospectives and stand-ups) can reinforce both autonomy and accountability:</p> <p>Use retrospectives to reflect on what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t, and let the team propose and own improvements. Implement agile practices that encourage self-organization and iterative delivery . 7. Address Antipatterns and Continuously Improve Be vigilant for leadership and process antipatterns that undermine ownership, such as passive leadership or unclear workflows. Osmani notes:</p> <p>\"By recognizing the signs of individual antipatterns, such as over-helping or trivial tweaking, teams can promote healthier collaboration and growth... Leadership antipatterns, like skeptical or passive leadership, remind us of the importance of active, empowering, and communicative leadership to steer projects toward success.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Leading Effective Engineering Teams </p> <ol> <li>In the Age of AI: Balance Human Judgment and Automation In the context of generative AI, Osmani and Reinhard emphasize not letting AI tools bypass learning or ownership:</li> </ol> <p>\"You can have juniors also attempt to solve tasks manually before using AI to automate it or to check or refine their work... It's really about just setting this culture within your team about not using AI as a crutch, but as something that will maybe help us with velocity, but it doesn't remove the need for us to learn and to understand. So treat it as a learning tool.\" \u2014 Addy Osmani, Tech Leadership Tuesday with Lena Reinhard </p> <p>How to apply:</p> <p>Use AI to augment, not replace, critical thinking and collaboration. Pair juniors and seniors in exercises where AI is a tool, not the solution. Maintain high standards for code quality and learning, even as you adopt new technologies .

Here are some strategies that might help you foster autonomy and accountability:</p> <p>1. Set Clear Expectations and Goals: Start by ensuring everyone knows what success looks like. This means setting clear, achievable goals and defining what \"done\" means for each task. When your team understands the objectives and the impact of their work, they're more likely to take ownership.</p> <p>2. Encourage Open Communication: Create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing ideas, asking questions, and expressing concerns. This openness builds trust and helps everyone feel more invested in the outcomes.</p> <p>3. Delegate Effectively: Trust your team by delegating tasks and responsibilities. When you delegate, make sure you're not just offloading work but also empowering team members to make decisions. Provide the necessary context and resources, then step back and let them lead.</p> <p>4. Foster a Culture of Learning: Encourage continuous learning and experimentation. When team members know they can try new things without fear of failure, they're more likely to take initiative. Celebrate both successes and learnings from failures.</p> <p>5. Provide Regular Feedback: Offer constructive feedback regularly, not just during performance reviews. This helps team members understand how they're doing and where they can improve. Be specific and focus on behaviors and outcomes.</p> <p>6. Recognize and Celebrate Achievements: Acknowledge individual and team accomplishments. Recognition can be a powerful motivator and reinforces the behaviors you want to see more of.</p> <p>7. Build Psychological Safety: Ensure your team feels safe to take risks and voice their opinions without fear of negative consequences. This is crucial for fostering innovation and accountability.</p> <p>8. Encourage Ownership of Processes: Involve your team in defining and refining processes. When they have a say in how work gets done, they're more likely to feel responsible for the outcomes.</p> <p>9. Lead by Example: Model the behavior you want to see. Show accountability in your actions and decisions, and your team will likely follow suit.</p> <p>Protip: Regularly check in with your team to understand their challenges and provide support. Sometimes, just knowing you're there to help can empower them to take more initiative.</p> <p>Remember, fostering autonomy and accountability is a journey, not a destination. It takes time and consistent effort, but the payoff in team effectiveness and satisfaction is well worth it. Keep iterating on these strategies, and you'll likely see positive changes in how your team operates.</p> <p>cl-gradio-pe1</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.2093 0.9889 <p>To foster autonomy and accountability, start by setting clear expectations and providing guardrails\u2014think of them as supportive guidelines rather than constraints. Trust is key, so let your team make decisions about their areas of expertise, whether that's technical approaches or timelines. Offer stretch assignments that challenge them to grow, and encourage a culture where they can experiment and learn from failure without fear. Be available for guidance, but avoid micromanaging; intervene only when necessary. Regular constructive feedback is crucial\u2014celebrate successes and collaboratively identify areas for improvement.

First, focus on empowering your teams by removing distractions and blockers, allowing them to operate more autonomously. This means facilitating an environment where they can thrive without needing constant oversight, which in turn enables you to focus on broader strategic goals.</p> <p>Next, work on expanding the self-sufficiency of your teams. This involves developing leaders within your organization who can replicate successful patterns and address challenges at a larger scale. By growing leaders, you ensure that the effectiveness is not just limited to your immediate team but is spread across the organization.</p> <p>Additionally, as your responsibilities grow, shift your focus from individual technical tasks to people and organizational considerations.

Drawing from my experience and the frameworks I\u2019ve shared in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent discussions on Tech Leadership Tuesday, here\u2019s how I\u2019d approach expanding your success patterns to larger teams:</p> <ol> <li>Leverage the 3 E\u2019s Model: Enable, Empower, Expand Scaling effectiveness starts with a repeatable model. The 3 E\u2019s\u2014Enable, Empower, Expand\u2014provide a structured approach:</li> </ol> <p>Enable: Clearly define what effectiveness means for your teams and organization. This isn\u2019t just about output, but about aligning on value, outcomes, and the metrics that matter for your business context. Share these definitions and aspirations widely so everyone is moving in the same direction. Empower: Remove blockers and delegate decision-making. As your teams grow, you can\u2019t be the bottleneck. Empower team leads and ICs to own decisions, and invest in mentorship so that knowledge and context are distributed, not centralized. Expand: Once you have a pattern that works for one team, adapt and scale it. This means making teams self-sufficient, then applying those success patterns\u2014like effective communication rituals, code review standards, or onboarding processes\u2014across other teams, with tweaks as needed for context. Always ensure alignment with organizational goals as you scale up . 2. Build a Culture of Continuous Improvement and Psychological Safety Continuous Improvement: Encourage teams to regularly reflect on what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. Use retrospectives and feedback loops to surface and address antipatterns\u2014like over-helping, trivial tweaking, or passive leadership\u2014that can undermine effectiveness at scale. This creates a culture where learning and adaptation are the norm, not the exception . Psychological Safety: As teams grow, maintaining psychological safety becomes more challenging but even more critical. People need to feel safe to share ideas, raise concerns, and admit mistakes. This is foundational for innovation and for scaling success patterns, especially in environments where ambiguity and change are constant . 3. Optimize Team Structure and Communication Right Team Size: Research and experience show that smaller teams (ideally under 10) are more effective, but as you scale, you\u2019ll need to manage the complexity of more communication links. Use sub-teams, clear interfaces, and strong leads to keep communication efficient and avoid coordination overhead . Diversity and Inclusion: Diverse teams are more innovative, but only if you foster an inclusive environment. As you scale, be intentional about supporting flexible work arrangements and ensuring all voices are heard, which helps avoid coordination breakdowns and unlocks the benefits of diversity . 4. Codify and Share Success Patterns Document and Share: When you find rituals, processes, or tools that work\u2014whether it\u2019s a code review checklist, onboarding playbook, or incident response protocol\u2014document them and make them accessible. Encourage teams to adapt these patterns, not just adopt them blindly. Case Studies and Storytelling: Share real-world examples of what\u2019s worked (and what hasn\u2019t) across teams. This helps others learn from both successes and failures, and builds a shared language for effectiveness . 5. Leadership Multiplication and High-Leverage Activities Multiply Leadership: Invest in developing new leaders. As you scale, you need more people who can model and propagate your success patterns. This means coaching, mentoring, and giving emerging leaders real responsibility. Focus on High-Leverage Activities: Identify and prioritize the activities that have the biggest impact on effectiveness\u2014like improving onboarding, automating repetitive tasks, or refining your incident response. Feed opportunities and starve problems by focusing resources where they\u2019ll make the most difference . 6. Adapt to the Age of AI Integrate AI Thoughtfully: As discussed in the Tech Leadership Tuesday session, AI tools can boost productivity, but they also introduce new challenges\u2014like ensuring code quality and maintaining mentorship for junior engineers. Be intentional about how you introduce AI, measure its impact, and ensure it augments rather than replaces the learning and collaboration that drive long-term effectiveness . Maintain Human Connection: Even as you scale and adopt new tools, prioritize human connection, creativity, and critical thinking. Don\u2019t let AI or process become a substitute for thoughtful leadership and real user value . 7. Always Be Scaling\u2014But Thoughtfully The \u201cThree Always\u201d of Leadership: Always be deciding, always be leaving (creating space for others to step up), and always be scaling. This mindset ensures you\u2019re not just growing for growth\u2019s sake, but scaling what works, evolving what doesn\u2019t, and building an organization that can adapt to new challenges .

Drawing from my experience and the frameworks I\u2019ve shared in Leading Effective Engineering Teams and recent discussions on Tech Leadership Tuesday, here\u2019s a practical, research-backed approach to help you level up your feedback skills:</p> <ol> <li>Make Feedback Regular, Structured, and Actionable Establish a Feedback Rhythm: Don\u2019t wait for annual reviews. Use regular one-on-ones, peer reviews, and sprint retrospectives as built-in opportunities for feedback. This normalizes feedback and reduces anxiety around it, making it a tool for growth rather than a source of stress . Be Specific and Actionable: Vague feedback (\u201cdo better next time\u201d) is rarely helpful. Instead, cite concrete examples and focus on observable behaviors. For instance, \u201cIn the last code review, I noticed you caught a critical bug\u2014great attention to detail. One area to work on is documenting your thought process so others can follow your logic more easily\u201d . Balance Positive and Constructive Feedback: Recognize strengths and achievements, not just areas for improvement. This keeps motivation high and ensures feedback is seen as supportive, not punitive .</li> <li>Tailor Feedback to the Individual Understand Individual Needs: Each team member has unique goals, learning styles, and sensitivities. Adapt your feedback style accordingly\u2014some may prefer directness, others may need more context or encouragement . Ask for Input: Invite your team to share how they prefer to receive feedback. This builds trust and psychological safety, which are foundational for effective teams .</li> <li>Foster a Culture of Continuous Improvement Encourage Peer Feedback: Create opportunities for team members to review each other\u2019s work. This not only distributes the feedback load but also builds a culture of shared learning and accountability . Use Retrospectives Effectively: At the end of each sprint or project phase, facilitate a team discussion on what went well and what could be improved. This collective reflection helps normalize feedback and makes it a team habit .</li> <li>Follow Up and Support Growth Check In on Progress: Feedback shouldn\u2019t be a one-off event. Revisit previous feedback in future one-on-ones, celebrate improvements, and offer additional guidance as needed. This shows you\u2019re invested in their development . Provide Resources and Opportunities: If someone needs to develop a skill, point them to relevant resources or stretch assignments. Feedback is most effective when paired with support .</li> <li>Model Openness and Vulnerability Seek Feedback Yourself: Ask your team for feedback on your own management style. This demonstrates humility and a commitment to growth, and it encourages a two-way feedback culture . Acknowledge Uncertainty: Especially in fast-changing environments (like those shaped by generative AI), be transparent about what you know and what you\u2019re still figuring out. This builds trust and psychological safety .

Here are some strategies you can use to improve your feedback skills, inspired by principles from leadership literature and practices:</p> <p>basic-gpt4o</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.5254 0.1266 <p>As Addy Osmani, I'd be glad to share some strategies to help you provide effective feedback to your team. Providing feedback is a crucial part of being an engineering manager, and doing it well can significantly impact your team's performance and morale. Here are some strategies to consider:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Be Specific and Actionable: When giving feedback, be clear about what the issue is and provide specific examples. Instead of saying, \"Your code needs improvement,\" you might say, \"In the last project, I noticed that the code lacked comments, which made it difficult for others to understand. Adding comments can improve code readability.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Timeliness: Provide feedback as soon as possible after the event or behavior you want to address. This ensures that the context is fresh in everyone's mind and allows for quicker adjustments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balance Positive and Constructive Feedback: While it's important to address areas for improvement, don't forget to acknowledge what your team members are doing well. This balance helps maintain morale and encourages positive behavior.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact): This model helps structure your feedback. Describe the Situation, explain the specific Behavior, and discuss the Impact it had. For example, \"During the team meeting (Situation), you interrupted others frequently (Behavior), which made it difficult for them to share their ideas (Impact).\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Encourage a Growth Mindset: Frame feedback in a way that encourages learning and development. Emphasize that skills can be developed through effort and persistence.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a Safe Environment: Foster an environment where team members feel comfortable receiving and giving feedback. Encourage open communication and make it clear that feedback is a tool for growth, not criticism.</p> </li> <li> <p>Listen Actively: Feedback should be a two-way conversation. Listen to your team member's perspective and be open to their input. This can provide valuable insights and help build trust.</p> </li> <li> <p>Follow Up: After providing feedback, check in with your team members to see how they're progressing. Offer additional support or resources if needed, and acknowledge improvements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tailor Your Approach: Different team members may respond differently to feedback. Understand their individual preferences and adapt your approach accordingly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Practice Empathy: Put yourself in your team member's shoes and consider how they might feel receiving the feedback. This can help you deliver it in a more compassionate and effective manner.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By incorporating these strategies, you'll be better equipped to provide feedback that is constructive, supportive, and ultimately beneficial for your team's growth and success. Remember, effective feedback is a skill that improves with practice, so keep refining your approach as you gain more experience.</p> <p>openai-generated-prompt</p> Burrows Delta Andrew Model 0.477 0.0314 <p>Hey there! First off, congrats on stepping into the engineering manager role. It's a journey filled with opportunities to grow both yourself and your team. Providing effective feedback is a crucial part of that journey, and it's great that you're focusing on improving this skill. Let's dive into some strategies that can help you deliver feedback that's clear, constructive, and impactful.</p> <p>1. Be Specific and Actionable: When giving feedback, aim for clarity. Instead of saying, \"Your code needs improvement,\" try something like, \"I noticed the function <code>calculateMetrics</code> could be more efficient by using a hashmap instead of a list for lookups.\" This gives your team member a clear direction on what to improve.</p> <p>2. Balance Positive and Constructive Feedback: It's important to recognize what's working well, not just what's not. This helps build confidence and reinforces positive behaviors. A good rule of thumb is the \"praise sandwich\"\u2014start with something positive, provide constructive feedback, and end on a positive note.</p> <p>3. Focus on Behavior, Not Personality: Keep feedback objective and centered on actions or outcomes. Instead of saying, \"You're not a team player,\" you might say, \"I noticed you didn't participate in the last two team meetings. Your input is valuable, and we'd love to hear your thoughts.\"</p> <p>4. Encourage a Growth Mindset: Frame feedback in a way that encourages learning and development. Use language that suggests improvement is possible and expected. For example, \"With a bit more focus on testing, your code quality could really shine.\"</p> <p>5. Create a Safe Environment: Psychological safety is key. Ensure your team feels comfortable receiving feedback by fostering an environment of trust and respect. Encourage open dialogue and be approachable.</p> <p>6. Regular Check-ins: Don't wait for formal reviews to give feedback. Regular one-on-ones are a great opportunity to provide ongoing feedback and support. This helps prevent surprises and keeps everyone aligned.</p> <p>7. Ask for Feedback: Feedback is a two-way street. Encourage your team to give you feedback on your management style and how you can support them better. This not only helps you grow but also models the behavior you want to see.</p> <p>8. Document and Follow Up: Keep track of feedback given and follow up on progress.

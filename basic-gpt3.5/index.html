<p class="admonition-title"><em>Sample model</em> | I'm a new engineering leader and I've noticed that one of my team members is always the go-to person for a specific module. How can I ensure that this doesn't become a problem for the team?</p>
<p>To ensure that relying too heavily on one team member for a specific module doesn't become a problem for the team, consider the following strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cross-training: Encourage the team member who is the go-to person for the module to share their knowledge and expertise with other team members. This can involve organizing training sessions, pair programming, or shadowing opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rotation of responsibilities: Rotate the responsibilities for the specific module among team members to ensure that everyone has a chance to work on it and gain experience. This can help prevent burnout and promote a more collaborative team environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation: Encourage the team member to document their work, processes, and best practices related to the module. This can help ensure that knowledge is shared and accessible to other team members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage collaboration: Foster a culture of collaboration within the team by encouraging open communication, sharing ideas, and working together on projects. This can help prevent silos of knowledge and promote a more cohesive team dynamic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognize and reward contributions: Acknowledge the contributions of the team member who is the go-to person for the module, but also recognize the efforts of other team members who contribute to the project. This can help motivate team members and prevent resentment or feelings of being undervalued.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By implementing these strategies, you can help prevent over-reliance on one team member for a specific module and promote a more balanced and collaborative team environment.</p>
